This can be due to damage or destruction of the adrenal cortex. These deficiencies include glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid hormones as well. These are adrenal dysgenesis (the gland has not formed adequately during development), impaired steroidogenesis (the gland is present but is biochemically unable to produce cortisol), or adrenal destruction (disease processes leading to glandular damage).\nDarkening (hyperpigmentation) of the skin, including areas not exposed to the sun – characteristic sites of darkening are skin creases (e.g., of the hands), nipple, and the inside of the cheek (buccal mucosa); also, old scars may darken. This occurs because melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) and ACTH share the same precursor molecule, pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC). After production in the anterior pituitary gland, POMC gets cleaved into gamma-MSH, ACTH, and beta-lipotropin. The subunit ACTH undergoes further cleavage to produce alpha-MSH, the most important MSH for skin pigmentation. In secondary and tertiary forms of adrenal insufficiency, skin darkening does not occur, as ACTH is not overproduced.", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addison%27s_disease"}

Individual cases have been reported in a grey seal, a red panda, a flying fox, and a sloth.\nIn dogs, hypoadrenocorticism has been diagnosed in many breeds. Vague symptoms, which wax and wane, can cause delay in recognition of the presence of the disease. Female dogs appear more affected than male dogs, though this may not be the case in all breeds. The disease is most often diagnosed in dogs that are young to middle-aged, but it can occur at any age from 4 months to 14 years. Treatment of hypoadrenocorticism must replace the hormones (cortisol and aldosterone) which the dog cannot produce itself. This is achieved either by daily treatment with fludrocortisone, or monthly injections with desoxycorticosterone pivalate (DOCP) and daily treatment with a glucocorticoid, such as prednisone. Several follow-up blood tests are required so the dose can be adjusted until the dog is receiving the correct amount of treatment, because the medications used in the therapy of hypoadrenocorticism can cause excessive thirst and urination if not prescribed at the lowest effective dose. In anticipation of stressful situations, such as staying in a boarding kennel, dogs require an increased dose of prednisone. Lifelong treatment is required, but the prognosis for dogs with hypoadrenocorticism is very good. Michigan State University has conducted a study that explores the process of getting to the lowest effective dose safely. This must be done slowly over time, so that crisis does not occur. Medications should never be suddenly stopped, as this will cause severe medical issues quickly. \nHypoadrenocorticism can also occur in cats but is extremely rare. It is usually caused by an immune reaction, resulting in adrenal insufficiency.

Until the early 1970s, the idea of a single amyloid substance predominated. Various descriptive classification systems were proposed based on the organ distribution of amyloid deposits and clinical findings. Most classification systems included primary (i.e., idiopathic) amyloidosis, in which no associated clinical condition was identified, and secondary amyloidosis (i.e., secondary to chronic inflammatory conditions). Some classification systems included myeloma-associated, familial, and localized amyloidosis.\nThe modern era of amyloidosis classification began in the late 1960s with the development of methods to make amyloid fibrils soluble. These methods permitted scientists to study the chemical properties of amyloids. Descriptive terms such as primary amyloidosis, secondary amyloidosis, and others (e.g., senile amyloidosis), which are not based on cause, provide little useful information and are no longer recommended.\nThe modern classification of amyloid disease tends to use an abbreviation of the protein that makes the majority of deposits, prefixed with the letter A. For example, amyloidosis caused by transthyretin is termed \"ATTR\". Deposition patterns vary between people but are almost always composed of just one amyloidogenic protein. Deposition can be systemic (affecting many different organ systems) or organ-specific. Many amyloidoses are inherited, due to mutations in the precursor protein.\nOther forms are due to different diseases causing overabundant or abnormal protein production – such as with overproduction of immunoglobulin light chains (termed AL amyloidosis), or with continuous overproduction of acute phase proteins in chronic inflammation (which can lead to AA amyloidosis).\nAbout 60 amyloid proteins have been identified so far. Of those, at least 36 have been associated with a human disease.\nAll amyloid fibril proteins start with the letter \"A\" followed by the protein suffix (and any applicable specification).

However, in 1922 Gordon made an exhaustive comparison from specimens collected in Brazil, South Africa and India, and his conclusion was that there were no significant distinction. Other parasitologists were also convinced of this so that the two names were again considered synonymous.

The copulatory bursa is a unique feature of Strongylida members, thus making it a useful means for identifying members of this suborder; it is also used to distinguish members within the suborder due to differences in bursa appearance between species. The vulva of A. caninum females is located at the boundary of the second and final thirds of the body.\nThe teeth of A. caninum are found in the buccal capsule and divided into three sets.  Two ventral sets form a lower-jaw equivalent, while a further set projects from the dorsal side and loosely equates to an upper jaw.

By 4–5 days, the larvae have moulted twice and are now able to infect a host.  Migration occurs from the feces into the surrounding soil.  Two routes of infection from the environment exist.  The first route involves penetration of skin at hair follicles or sweat glands, especially between the footpads where contact with soil is frequent and the skin is thinner than otherwise.  Secretion of a protease by A. caninum is thought to aid this process.  The larvae then migrate through the dermis of the skin, enter the circulatory system and are carried to the lungs.  A. caninum larvae exit the blood at the lungs, move from the alveoli up through the trachea and are swallowed to end up in the intestine.\nThe second and more common route to the small intestine is by direct ingestion of A. caninum by the host, but the subsequent process is identical in either case.  During this third stage of the larva, male or female reproductive organs become established.  Larvae of this stage have been shown to secrete a molecule (Ac-asp-2) related to venom allergens in response to host-specific signals; this is thought to have a possible role in helping with the infection process.  A third and final moulting occurs, resulting in the mature form of A. caninum, which then feeds on mucosa and blood of the small intestinal wall.  The trigger of feeding is understood to be a receptor-mediated response; however, the detail of this process has yet to be established.

Deficiency in folate or vitamin B12 can be due either to inadequate intake or insufficient absorption. Folate deficiency normally does not produce neurological symptoms, while B12 deficiency does.\nPernicious anemia is caused by a lack of intrinsic factor, which is required to absorb vitamin B12 from food. A lack of intrinsic factor may arise from an autoimmune condition targeting the parietal cells (atrophic gastritis) that produce intrinsic factor or against intrinsic factor itself. These lead to poor absorption of vitamin B12.\nMacrocytic anemia can also be caused by the removal of the functional portion of the stomach, such as during gastric bypass surgery, leading to reduced vitamin B12/folate absorption. Therefore, one must always be aware of anemia following this procedure.\nHypothyroidism\nAlcoholism commonly causes a macrocytosis, although not specifically anemia. Other types of liver disease can also cause macrocytosis.\nDrugs such as methotrexate, zidovudine, and other substances may inhibit DNA replication such as heavy metals\nMacrocytic anemia can be further divided into \"megaloblastic anemia\" or \"nonmegaloblastic macrocytic anemia\". The cause of megaloblastic anemia is primarily a failure of DNA synthesis with preserved RNA synthesis, which results in restricted cell division of the progenitor cells. The megaloblastic anemias often present with neutrophil hypersegmentation (six to 10 lobes). The nonmegaloblastic macrocytic anemias have different etiologies (i.e., unimpaired DNA globin synthesis), which occur, for example, with excessive alcohol use.\nIn addition to the nonspecific symptoms of anemia, specific features of vitamin B12 deficiency include peripheral neuropathy and subacute combined degeneration of the cord with resulting balance difficulties from posterior column spinal cord pathology. Other features may include a smooth, red tongue and glossitis.\nThe treatment for vitamin B12-deficient anemia was first devised by William Murphy, who bled dogs to make them anemic, and then fed them various substances to see what (if anything) would make them healthy again. He discovered that ingesting large amounts of liver seemed to cure the disease. George Minot and George Whipple then set about to isolate the curative substance chemically and ultimately were able to isolate the vitamin B12 from the liver.

This approach can be contrasted with field studies in which animals are observed in their natural environments or habitats. Experimental research with animals is usually conducted in universities, medical schools, pharmaceutical companies, defense establishments, and commercial facilities that provide animal-testing services to the industry. The focus of animal testing varies on a continuum from pure research, focusing on developing fundamental knowledge of an organism, to applied research, which may focus on answering some questions of great practical importance, such as finding a cure for a disease. Examples of applied research include testing disease treatments, breeding, defense research, and toxicology, including cosmetics testing. In education, animal testing is sometimes a component of biology or psychology courses.\nResearch using animal models has been central to most of the achievements of modern medicine. It has contributed to most of the basic knowledge in fields such as human physiology and biochemistry, and has played significant roles in fields such as neuroscience and infectious disease. The results have included the near-eradication of polio and the development of organ transplantation, and have benefited both humans and animals. From 1910 to 1927, Thomas Hunt Morgan's work with the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster identified chromosomes as the vector of inheritance for genes, and Eric Kandel wrote that Morgan's discoveries \"helped transform biology into an experimental science\". Research in model organisms led to further medical advances, such as the production of the diphtheria antitoxin and the 1922 discovery of insulin and its use in treating diabetes, which was previously fatal. Modern general anaesthetics such as halothane were also developed through studies on model organisms, and are necessary for modern, complex surgical operations. Other 20th-century medical advances and treatments that relied on research performed in animals include organ transplant techniques, the heart-lung machine, antibiotics, and the whooping cough vaccine.\nAnimal testing is widely used to aid in research of human disease when human experimentation would be unfeasible or unethical. This strategy is made possible by the common descent of all living organisms, and the conservation of metabolic and developmental pathways and genetic material over the course of evolution. Performing experiments in model organisms allows for better understanding of the disease process without the added risk of harming an actual human. The species of the model organism is usually chosen so that it reacts to disease or its treatment in a way that resembles human physiology as needed. Biological activity in a model organism does not ensure an effect in humans, and care must be taken when generalizing from one organism to another. However, many drugs, treatments and cures for human diseases are developed in part with the guidance of animal models. Treatments for animal diseases have also been developed, including for rabies, anthrax, glanders, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), tuberculosis, Texas cattle fever, classical swine fever (hog cholera), heartworm, and other parasitic infections. Animal experimentation continues to be required for biomedical research, and is used with the aim of solving medical problems such as Alzheimer's disease, AIDS, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, and other conditions in which there is no useful in vitro model system available.\nThe annual use of vertebrate animals—from zebrafish to non-human primates—was estimated at 192 million as of 2015. In the European Union, vertebrate species represent 93% of animals used in research, and 11.5 million animals were used there in 2011. The mouse (Mus musculus) is associated with many important biological discoveries of the 20th and 21st centuries, and by one estimate, the number of mice and rats used in the United States alone in 2001 was 80 million. In 2013, it was reported that mammals (mice and rats), fish, amphibians, and reptiles together accounted for over 85% of research animals. In 2022, a law was passed in the United States that eliminated the FDA requirement that all drugs be tested on animals.\nAnimal testing is regulated to varying degrees in different countries. In some cases it is strictly controlled while others have more relaxed regulations. There are ongoing debates about the ethics and necessity of animal testing. Proponents argue that it has led to significant advancements in medicine and other fields while opponents raise concerns about cruelty towards animals and question its effectiveness and reliability. There are efforts underway to find alternatives to animal testing such as computer simulation models, organs-on-chips technology that mimics human organs for lab tests, microdosing techniques which involve administering small doses of test compounds to human volunteers instead of non-human animals for safety tests or drug screenings; positron emission tomography (PET) scans which allow scanning of the human brain without harming humans; comparative epidemiological studies among human populations; simulators and computer programs for teaching purposes; among others.", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing"}

{"condition": "Animal testing on dogs", "species": "dog", "section": "unlabelled", "paragraph_id": 2, "text": "History\nThe earliest references to animal testing are found in the writings of the Greeks in the 2nd and 4th centuries BCE. Aristotle and Erasistratus were among the first to perform experiments on living animals. Galen, a 2nd-century Roman physician, performed post-mortem dissections of pigs and goats. Avenzoar, a 12th-century Arabic physician in Moorish Spain introduced an experimental method of testing surgical procedures before applying them to human patients. Discoveries in the 18th and 19th centuries included Antoine Lavoisier's use of a guinea pig in a calorimeter to prove that respiration was a form of combustion, and Louis Pasteur's demonstration of the germ theory of disease in the 1880s using anthrax in sheep. Robert Koch used animal testing of mice and guinea pigs to discover the bacteria that cause anthrax and tuberculosis. In the 1890s, Ivan Pavlov famously used dogs to describe classical conditioning.\nResearch using animal models has been central to most of the achievements of modern medicine. It has contributed most of the basic knowledge in fields such as human physiology and biochemistry, and has played significant roles in fields such as neuroscience and infectious disease. For example, the results have included the near-eradication of polio and the development of organ transplantation, and have benefited both humans and animals. From 1910 to 1927, Thomas Hunt Morgan's work with the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster identified chromosomes as the vector of inheritance for genes. Drosophila became one of the first, and for some time the most widely used, model organisms, and Eric Kandel wrote that Morgan's discoveries \"helped transform biology into an experimental science\". D. melanogaster remains one of the most widely used eukaryotic model organisms. During the same time period, studies on mouse genetics in the laboratory of William Ernest Castle in collaboration with Abbie Lathrop led to generation of the DBA (\"dilute, brown and non-agouti\") inbred mouse strain and the systematic generation of other inbred strains. The mouse has since been used extensively as a model organism and is associated with many important biological discoveries of the 20th and 21st centuries.\nIn the late 19th century, Emil von Behring isolated the diphtheria toxin and demonstrated its effects in guinea pigs. He went on to develop an antitoxin against diphtheria in animals and then in humans, which resulted in the modern methods of immunization and largely ended diphtheria as a threatening disease. The diphtheria antitoxin is famously commemorated in the Iditarod race, which is modeled after the delivery of antitoxin in the 1925 serum run to Nome. The success of animal studies in producing the diphtheria antitoxin has also been attributed as a cause for the decline of the early 20th-century opposition to animal research in the United States.\nSubsequent research in model organisms led to further medical advances, such as Frederick Banting's research in dogs, which determined that the isolates of pancreatic secretion could be used to treat dogs with diabetes. This led to the 1922 discovery of insulin (with John Macleod) and its use in treating diabetes, which had previously meant death. John Cade's research in guinea pigs discovered the anticonvulsant properties of lithium salts, which revolutionized the treatment of bipolar disorder, replacing the previous treatments of lobotomy or electroconvulsive therapy. Modern general anaesthetics, such as halothane and related compounds, were also developed through studies on model organisms, and are necessary for modern, complex surgical operations.\nIn the 1940s, Jonas Salk used rhesus monkey studies to isolate the most virulent forms of the polio virus, which led to his invention of the polio vaccine. The vaccine, which was made publicly available in 1955, reduced the incidence of polio 15-fold in the United States over the following five years. Albert Sabin improved the vaccine by passing the polio virus through animal hosts, including monkeys; the Sabin vaccine was produced for mass consumption in 1963, and had virtually eradicated polio in the United States by 1965. It has been estimated that developing and producing the vaccines required the use of 100,000 rhesus monkeys, with 65 doses of vaccine produced from each monkey. Sabin wrote in 1992, \"Without the use of animals and human beings, it would have been impossible to acquire the important knowledge needed to prevent much suffering and premature death not only among humans, but also among animals.\"\nOn 3 November 1957, a Soviet dog, Laika, became the first of many animals to orbit the Earth. In the 1970s, antibiotic treatments and vaccines for leprosy were developed using armadillos, then given to humans. The ability of humans to change the genetics of animals took an enormous step forward in 1974 when Rudolf Jaenisch could produce the first transgenic mammal, by integrating DNA from simians into the genome of mice. This genetic research progressed rapidly and, in 1996, Dolly the sheep was born, the first mammal to be cloned from an adult cell.\nOther 20th-century medical advances and treatments that relied on research performed in animals include organ transplant techniques, the heart-lung machine, antibiotics, and the whooping cough vaccine. Treatments for animal diseases have also been developed, including for rabies, anthrax, glanders, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), tuberculosis, Texas cattle fever, classical swine fever (hog cholera), heartworm, and other parasitic infections. Animal experimentation continues to be required for biomedical research, and is used with the aim of solving medical problems such as Alzheimer's disease, AIDS, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, many headaches, and other conditions in which there is no useful in vitro model system available.\nToxicology testing became important in the 20th century. In the 19th century, laws regulating drugs were more relaxed. For example, in the US, the government could only ban a drug after they had prosecuted a company for selling products that harmed customers. However, in response to the Elixir Sulfanilamide disaster of 1937 in which the eponymous drug killed over 100 users, the US Congress passed laws that required safety testing of drugs on animals before they could be marketed. Other countries enacted similar legislation. In the 1960s, in reaction to the Thalidomide tragedy, further laws were passed requiring safety testing on pregnant animals before a drug can be sold.", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing"}

The most frequently used invertebrate species are Drosophila melanogaster, a fruit fly, and Caenorhabditis elegans, a nematode worm. In the case of C. elegans, the worm's body is completely transparent and the precise lineage of all the organism's cells is known, while studies in the fly D. melanogaster can use an amazing array of genetic tools. These invertebrates offer some advantages over vertebrates in animal testing, including their short life cycle and the ease with which large numbers may be housed and studied. However, the lack of an adaptive immune system and their simple organs prevent worms from being used in several aspects of medical research such as vaccine development. Similarly, the fruit fly immune system differs greatly from that of humans, and diseases in insects can be different from diseases in vertebrates; however, fruit flies and waxworms can be useful in studies to identify novel virulence factors or pharmacologically active compounds.\nSeveral invertebrate systems are considered acceptable alternatives to vertebrates in early-stage discovery screens. Because of similarities between the innate immune system of insects and mammals, insects can replace mammals in some types of studies. Drosophila melanogaster and the Galleria mellonella waxworm have been particularly important for analysis of virulent traits of mammalian pathogens. Waxworms and other insects have also proven valuable for the identification of pharmaceutical compounds with favorable bioavailability. The decision to adopt such models generally involves accepting a lower degree of biological similarity with mammals for significant gains in experimental throughput.", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing"}

With the advent of genetic engineering technology, genetically modified mice can be generated to order and can provide models for a range of human diseases.

The most common use of dogs is in the safety assessment of new medicines for human or veterinary use as a second species following testing in rodents, in accordance with the regulations set out in the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use. One of the most significant advancements in medical science involves the use of dogs in developing the answers to insulin production in the body for diabetics and the role of the pancreas in this process. They found that the pancreas was responsible for producing insulin in the body and that removal of the pancreas, resulted in the development of diabetes in the dog. After re-injecting the pancreatic extract (insulin), the blood glucose levels were significantly lowered.\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal Welfare Report shows that 60,979 dogs were used in USDA-registered facilities in 2016.

In the U.S., under the Animal Welfare Act and the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (the Guide), published by the National Academy of Sciences, any procedure can be performed on an animal if it can be successfully argued that it is scientifically justified. Researchers are required to consult with the institution's veterinarian and its Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), which every research facility is obliged to maintain. The IACUC must ensure that alternatives, including non-animal alternatives, have been considered, that the experiments are not unnecessarily duplicative, and that pain relief is given unless it would interfere with the study. The IACUCs regulate all vertebrates in testing at institutions receiving federal funds in the USA. Although the Animal Welfare Act does not include purpose-bred rodents and birds, these species are equally regulated under Public Health Service policies that govern the IACUCs. The Public Health Service policy oversees the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The CDC conducts infectious disease research on nonhuman primates, rabbits, mice, and other animals, while FDA requirements cover use of animals in pharmaceutical research. Animal Welfare Act (AWA) regulations are enforced by the USDA, whereas Public Health Service regulations are enforced by OLAW and in many cases by AAALAC.\nAccording to the 2014 U.S. Department of Agriculture Office of the Inspector General (OIG) report—which looked at the oversight of animal use during a three-year period—\"some Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees ...did not adequately approve, monitor, or report on experimental procedures on animals\". The OIG found that \"as a result, animals are not always receiving basic humane care and treatment and, in some cases, pain and distress are not minimized during and after experimental procedures\". According to the report, within a three-year period, nearly half of all American laboratories with regulated species were cited for AWA violations relating to improper IACUC oversight. The USDA OIG made similar findings in a 2005 report. With only a broad number of 120 inspectors, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) oversees more than 12,000 facilities involved in research, exhibition, breeding, or dealing of animals. Others have criticized the composition of IACUCs, asserting that the committees are predominantly made up of animal researchers and university representatives who may be biased against animal welfare concerns.\nLarry Carbone, a laboratory animal veterinarian, writes that, in his experience, IACUCs take their work very seriously regardless of the species involved, though the use of non-human primates always raises what he calls a \"red flag of special concern\". A study published in Science magazine in July 2001 confirmed the low reliability of IACUC reviews of animal experiments. Funded by the National Science Foundation, the three-year study found that animal-use committees that do not know the specifics of the university and personnel do not make the same approval decisions as those made by animal-use committees that do know the university and personnel. Specifically, blinded committees more often ask for more information rather than approving studies.\nScientists in India are protesting a recent guideline issued by the University Grants Commission to ban the use of live animals in universities and laboratories.\nOn April 10, 2025, the FDA announced a Roadmap to Reducing Animal Testing in Preclinical Safety Studies to reduce and phase out animal testing and promote alternatives such as advanced computer simulations and lab grown human \"organoids\" and organ-on-a-chip systems. Over 90% of drugs that appear safe and effective in animals do not go on to receive FDA approval in humans predominantly due to safety and/or efficacy issues.\nOn April 29, 2025, the US NIH announced a new initiative to prioritize human-based research technologies and reduce use of animals in NIH-funded research. On July 8, 2025 at a collaborative FDA & NIH Workshop on Reducing Animal Testing, the NIH announced that NIH will no longer seek proposals exclusively for animal models and that all new NIH funding opportunities moving forward should incorporate language on consideration of NAMs.", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing"}

By comparing with EU data, where all vertebrate species are counted, Speaking of Research estimated that around 12 million vertebrates were used in research in the US in 2016. A 2015 article published in the Journal of Medical Ethics, argued that the use of animals in the US has dramatically increased in recent years. Researchers found this increase is largely the result of an increased reliance on genetically modified mice in animal studies.\nIn 1995, researchers at Tufts University Center for Animals and Public Policy estimated that 14–21 million animals were used in American laboratories in 1992, a reduction from a high of 50 million used in 1970. In 1986, the U.S. Congress Office of Technology Assessment reported that estimates of the animals used in the U.S. range from 10 million to upwards of 100 million each year, and that their own best estimate was at least 17 million to 22 million. In 2016, the Department of Agriculture listed 60,979 dogs, 18,898 cats, 71,188 non-human primates, 183,237 guinea pigs, 102,633 hamsters, 139,391 rabbits, 83,059 farm animals, and 161,467 other mammals, a total of 820,812, a figure that includes all mammals except purpose-bred mice and rats. The use of dogs and cats in research in the U.S. decreased from 1973 to 2016 from 195,157 to 60,979, and from 66,165 to 18,898, respectively.\nIn the UK, Home Office figures show that 3.79 million procedures were carried out in 2017. 2,960 procedures used non-human primates, down over 50% since 1988. A \"procedure\" refers here to an experiment that might last minutes, several months, or years. Most animals are used in only one procedure: animals are frequently euthanized after the experiment; however death is the endpoint of some procedures.\nThe procedures conducted on animals in the UK in 2017 were categorised as: 43% (1.61 million) sub-threshold, 4% (0.14 million) non-recovery, 36% (1.35 million) mild, 15% (0.55 million) moderate, and 4% (0.14 million) severe. A 'severe' procedure would be, for instance, any test where death is the end-point or fatalities are expected, whereas a 'mild' procedure would be something like a blood test or an MRI scan.", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing"}

Some Class B dealers have been accused of kidnapping pets and illegally trapping strays, a practice known as bunching. It was in part out of public concern over the sale of pets to research facilities that the 1966 Laboratory Animal Welfare Act was ushered in—the Senate Committee on Commerce reported in 1966 that stolen pets had been retrieved from Veterans Administration facilities, the Mayo Institute, the University of Pennsylvania, Stanford University, and Harvard and Yale Medical Schools. The USDA recovered at least a dozen stolen pets during a raid on a Class B dealer in Arkansas in 2003.\nFour states in the U.S.—Minnesota, Utah, Oklahoma, and Iowa—require their shelters to provide animals to research facilities. Fourteen states explicitly prohibit the practice, while the remainder either allow it or have no relevant legislation.\nIn the European Union, animal sources are governed by Council Directive 86/609/EEC, which requires lab animals to be specially bred, unless the animal has been lawfully imported and is not a wild animal or a stray. The latter requirement may also be exempted by special arrangement. In 2010 the Directive was revised with EU Directive 2010/63/EU. In the UK, most animals used in experiments are bred for the purpose under the 1988 Animal Protection Act, but wild-caught primates may be used if exceptional and specific justification can be established. The United States also allows the use of wild-caught primates; between 1995 and 1999, 1,580 wild baboons were imported into the U.S. Most of the primates imported are handled by Charles River Laboratories or by Fortrea, which are very active in the international primate trade.", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing"}
{"condition": "Animal testing on dogs", "species": "dog", "section": "unlabelled", "paragraph_id": 15, "text": "Pain and suffering\nIt is generally accepted that animals can feel pain. The extent to which animal testing causes pain and suffering, and the capacity of animals to experience and comprehend them, has been debated.\nAccording to the USDA, in 2016 501,560 animals (61%) (not including rats, mice, birds, or invertebrates) were used in procedures that did not include more than momentary pain or distress. 247,882 (31%) animals were used in procedures in which pain or distress was relieved by anesthesia, while 71,370 (9%) were used in studies that would cause pain or distress that would not be relieved.\nThe idea that animals might not feel pain as human beings feel it traces back to the 17th-century French philosopher, René Descartes, who argued that animals do not experience pain and suffering because they lack consciousness. Bernard Rollin of Colorado State University, the principal author of two U.S. federal laws regulating pain relief for animals, writes that researchers remained unsure into the 1980s as to whether animals experience pain, and that veterinarians trained in the U.S. before 1989 were simply taught to ignore animal pain. In his interactions with scientists and other veterinarians, he was regularly asked to \"prove\" that animals are conscious, and to provide \"scientifically acceptable\" grounds for claiming that they feel pain. Carbone writes that the view that animals feel pain differently is now a minority view. Academic reviews of the topic are more equivocal, noting that although the argument that animals have at least simple conscious thoughts and feelings has strong support, some critics continue to question how reliably animal mental states can be determined. However, some canine experts are stating that, while intelligence does differ animal to animal, dogs have the intelligence of a two to two-and-a-half-year old. This does support the idea that dogs, at the very least, have some form of consciousness. The ability of invertebrates to experience pain and suffering is less clear, however, legislation in several countries (e.g. U.K., New Zealand, Norway) protects some invertebrate species if they are being used in animal testing.\nIn the U.S., the defining text on animal welfare regulation in animal testing is the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. This defines the parameters that govern animal testing in the U.S. It states \"The ability to experience and respond to pain is widespread in the animal kingdom...Pain is a stressor and, if not relieved, can lead to unacceptable levels of stress and distress in animals.\" The Guide states that the ability to recognize the symptoms of pain in different species is vital in efficiently applying pain relief and that it is essential for the people caring for and using animals to be entirely familiar with these symptoms. On the subject of analgesics used to relieve pain, the Guide states \"The selection of the most appropriate analgesic or anesthetic should reflect professional judgment as to which best meets clinical and humane requirements without compromising the scientific aspects of the research protocol\". Accordingly, all issues of animal pain and distress, and their potential treatment with analgesia and anesthesia, are required regulatory issues in receiving animal protocol approval. Currently, traumatic methods of marking laboratory animals are being replaced with non-invasive alternatives.\nIn 2019, Katrien Devolder and Matthias Eggel proposed gene editing research animals to remove the ability to feel pain. This would be an intermediate step towards eventually stopping all experimentation on animals and adopting alternatives. Additionally, this would not stop research animals from experiencing psychological harm.", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing"}

However, while policy makers consider suffering to be the central issue and see animal euthanasia as a way to reduce suffering, others, such as the RSPCA, argue that the lives of laboratory animals have intrinsic value. Regulations focus on whether particular methods cause pain and suffering, not whether their death is undesirable in itself. The animals are euthanized at the end of studies for sample collection or post-mortem examination; during studies if their pain or suffering falls into certain categories regarded as unacceptable, such as depression, infection that is unresponsive to treatment, or the failure of large animals to eat for five days; or when they are unsuitable for breeding or unwanted for some other reason.\nMethods of euthanizing laboratory animals are chosen to induce rapid unconsciousness and death without pain or distress. The methods that are preferred are those published by councils of veterinarians. The animal can be made to inhale a gas, such as carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, by being placed in a chamber, or by use of a face mask, with or without prior sedation or anesthesia. Sedatives or anesthetics such as barbiturates can be given intravenously, or inhalant anesthetics may be used. Amphibians and fish may be immersed in water containing an anesthetic such as tricaine. Physical methods are also used, with or without sedation or anesthesia depending on the method. Recommended methods include decapitation (beheading) for small rodents or rabbits. Cervical dislocation (breaking the neck or spine) may be used for birds, mice, rats, and rabbits depending on the size and weight of the animal.  High-intensity microwave irradiation of the brain can preserve brain tissue and induce death in less than 1 second, but this is currently only used on rodents. Captive bolts may be used, typically on dogs, ruminants, horses, pigs and rabbits. It causes death by a concussion to the brain. Gunshot may be used, but only in cases where a penetrating captive bolt may not be used. Some physical methods are only acceptable after the animal is unconscious. Electrocution may be used for cattle, sheep, swine, foxes, and mink after the animals are unconscious, often by a prior electrical stun. Pithing (inserting a tool into the base of the brain) is usable on animals already unconscious.

Transgenic animals have specific genes inserted, modified or removed, to mimic specific conditions such as single gene disorders, such as Huntington's disease. Other models mimic complex, multifactorial diseases with genetic components, such as diabetes, or even transgenic mice that carry the same mutations that occur during the development of cancer. These models allow investigations on how and why the disease develops, as well as providing ways to develop and test new treatments. The vast majority of these transgenic models of human disease are lines of mice, the mammalian species in which genetic modification is most efficient. Smaller numbers of other animals are also used, including rats, pigs, sheep, fish, birds, and amphibians.\nStudies on models of naturally occurring disease and condition. Certain domestic and wild animals have a natural propensity or predisposition for certain conditions that are also found in humans. Cats are used as a model to develop immunodeficiency virus vaccines and to study leukemia because their natural predisposition to FIV and Feline leukemia virus. Certain breeds of dog experience narcolepsy making them the major model used to study the human condition. Armadillos and humans are among only a few animal species that naturally have leprosy; as the bacteria responsible for this disease cannot yet be grown in culture, armadillos are the primary source of bacilli used in leprosy vaccines.\nStudies on induced animal models of human diseases. Here, an animal is treated so that it develops pathology and symptoms that resemble a human disease. Examples include restricting blood flow to the brain to induce stroke, or giving neurotoxins that cause damage similar to that seen in Parkinson's disease. Much animal research into potential treatments for humans is wasted because it is poorly conducted and not evaluated through systematic reviews. For example, although such models are now widely used to study Parkinson's disease, the British anti-vivisection interest group BUAV argues that these models only superficially resemble the disease symptoms, without the same time course or cellular pathology. In contrast, scientists assessing the usefulness of animal models of Parkinson's disease, as well as the medical research charity The Parkinson's Appeal, state that these models were invaluable and that they led to improved surgical treatments such as pallidotomy, new drug treatments such as levodopa, and later deep brain stimulation.\nAnimal testing has also included the use of placebo testing.

According to 2005 EU figures, around one million animals are used every year in Europe in toxicology tests; which are about 10% of all procedures. According to Nature, 5,000 animals are used for each chemical being tested, with 12,000 needed to test pesticides. The tests are conducted without anesthesia, because interactions between drugs can affect how animals detoxify chemicals, and may interfere with the results.\nToxicology tests are used to examine finished products such as pesticides, medications, food additives, packing materials, and air freshener, or their chemical ingredients. Most tests involve testing ingredients rather than finished products, but according to BUAV, manufacturers believe these tests overestimate the toxic effects of substances; they therefore repeat the tests using their finished products to obtain a less toxic label.\nThe substances are applied to the skin or dripped into the eyes; injected intravenously, intramuscularly, or subcutaneously; inhaled either by placing a mask over the animals and restraining them, or by placing them in an inhalation chamber; or administered orally, through a tube into the stomach, or simply in the animal's food. Doses may be given once, repeated regularly for many months, or for the lifespan of the animal.\nThere are several different types of acute toxicity tests. The LD50 (\"Lethal Dose 50%\") test is used to evaluate the toxicity of a substance by determining the dose required to kill 50% of the test animal population. This test was removed from OECD international guidelines in 2002, replaced by methods such as the fixed dose procedure, which use fewer animals and cause less suffering. Abbott writes that, as of 2005, \"the LD50 acute toxicity test ... still accounts for one-third of all animal [toxicity] tests worldwide\".\nIrritancy can be measured using the Draize test, where a test substance is applied to an animal's eyes or skin, usually an albino rabbit. For Draize eye testing, the test involves observing the effects of the substance at intervals and grading any damage or irritation, but the test should be halted and the animal killed if it shows \"continuing signs of severe pain or distress\". The Humane Society of the United States writes that the procedure can cause redness, ulceration, hemorrhaging, cloudiness, or even blindness. This test has also been criticized by scientists for being cruel and inaccurate, subjective, over-sensitive, and failing to reflect human exposures in the real world. Although no accepted in vitro alternatives exist, a modified form of the Draize test called the low volume eye test may reduce suffering and provide more realistic results and this was adopted as the new standard in September 2009. However, the Draize test will still be used for substances that are not severe irritants.\nThe most stringent tests are reserved for drugs and foodstuffs. For these, a number of tests are performed, lasting less than a month (acute), one to three months (subchronic), and more than three months (chronic) to test general toxicity (damage to organs), eye and skin irritancy, mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, teratogenicity, and reproductive problems. The cost of the full complement of tests is several million dollars per substance and it may take three or four years to complete.\nThese toxicity tests provide, in the words of a 2006 United States National Academy of Sciences report, \"critical information for assessing hazard and risk potential\". Animal tests may overestimate risk, with false positive results being a particular problem, but false positives appear not to be prohibitively common. Variability in results arises from using the effects of high doses of chemicals in small numbers of laboratory animals to try to predict the effects of low doses in large numbers of humans. Although relationships do exist, opinion is divided on how to use data on one species to predict the exact level of risk in another.\nScientists face growing pressure to move away from using traditional animal toxicity tests to determine whether manufactured chemicals are safe.\nAmong variety of approaches to toxicity evaluation the ones which have attracted increasing interests are in vitro cell-based sensing methods applying fluorescence.", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing"}

Regan still sees ethical differences between killing human and non-human animals, and argues that to save the former it is permissible to kill the latter. Likewise, a \"moral dilemma\" view suggests that avoiding potential benefit to humans is unacceptable on similar grounds, and holds the issue to be a dilemma in balancing such harm to humans to the harm done to animals in research. In contrast, an abolitionist view in animal rights holds that there is no moral justification for any harmful research on animals that is not to the benefit of the individual animal. Bernard Rollin argues that benefits to human beings cannot outweigh animal suffering, and that human beings have no moral right to use an animal in ways that do not benefit that individual. Donald Watson has stated that vivisection and animal experimentation \"is probably the cruelest of all Man's attack on the rest of Creation.\" Another prominent position is that of philosopher Peter Singer, who argues that there are no grounds to include a being's species in considerations of whether their suffering is important in utilitarian moral considerations. Malcolm Macleod and collaborators argue that most controlled animal studies do not employ randomization, allocation concealment, and blinding outcome assessment, and that failure to employ these features exaggerates the apparent benefit of drugs tested in animals, leading to a failure to translate much animal research for human benefit.\nGovernments such as the Netherlands and New Zealand have responded to the public's concerns by outlawing invasive experiments on certain classes of non-human primates, particularly the great apes. In 2015, captive chimpanzees in the U.S. were added to the Endangered Species Act adding new road blocks to those wishing to experiment on them. Similarly, citing ethical considerations and the availability of alternative research methods, the U.S. NIH announced in 2013 that it would dramatically reduce and eventually phase out experiments on chimpanzees.\nThe British government has required that the cost to animals in an experiment be weighed against the gain in knowledge. Some medical schools and agencies in China, Japan, and South Korea have built cenotaphs for killed animals. In Japan there are also annual memorial services Ireisai (Japanese: 慰霊祭) for animals sacrificed at medical school.", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing"}

The fundamental properties of muscle physiology were determined with work done using frog muscles (including the force generating mechanism of all muscle, the length-tension relationship, and the force-velocity curve), and frogs are still the preferred model organism due to the long survival of muscles in vitro and the possibility of isolating intact single-fiber preparations (not possible in other organisms). Modern physical therapy and the understanding and treatment of muscular disorders is based on this work and subsequent work in mice (often engineered to express disease states such as muscular dystrophy).

The researcher's name, phone number, and address were posted on the website of the Primate Freedom Project. Demonstrations were held in front of his home. A Molotov cocktail was placed on the porch of what was believed to be the home of another UCLA primate researcher; instead, it was accidentally left on the porch of an elderly woman unrelated to the university. The Animal Liberation Front claimed responsibility for the attack. As a result of the campaign, the researcher sent an email to the Primate Freedom Project stating \"you win\", and \"please don't bother my family anymore\".

A 2006 review found multiple studies where there were promising results for new drugs in animals, but human clinical studies did not show the same results. The researchers suggested that this might be due to researcher bias, or simply because animal models do not accurately reflect human biology. Lack of meta-reviews may be partially to blame. Poor methodology is an issue in many studies. A 2009 review noted that many animal experiments did not use blinded experiments, a key element of many scientific studies in which researchers are not told about the part of the study they are working on to reduce bias.

{"condition": "Animal testing on dogs", "species": "dog", "section": "unlabelled", "paragraph_id": 35, "text": "Historical debate\nAs the experimentation on animals increased, especially the practice of vivisection, so did criticism and controversy. In 1655, the advocate of Galenic physiology Edmund O'Meara said that \"the miserable torture of vivisection places the body in an unnatural state\". O'Meara and others argued pain could affect animal physiology during vivisection, rendering results unreliable. There were also objections ethically, contending that the benefit to humans did not justify the harm to animals. Early objections to animal testing also came from another angle—many people believed animals were inferior to humans and so different that results from animals could not be applied to humans.\nOn the other side of the debate, those in favor of animal testing held that experiments on animals were necessary to advance medical and biological knowledge. Claude Bernard—who is sometimes known as the \"prince of vivisectors\" and the father of physiology, and whose wife, Marie Françoise Martin, founded the first anti-vivisection society in France in 1883—famously wrote in 1865 that \"the science of life is a superb and dazzlingly lighted hall which may be reached only by passing through a long and ghastly kitchen\". Arguing that \"experiments on animals [. . .] are entirely conclusive for the toxicology and hygiene of man [. . . T]he effects of these substances are the same on man as on animals, save for differences in degree\", Bernard established animal experimentation as part of the standard scientific method.\nIn 1896, the physiologist and physician Dr. Walter B. Cannon said \"The antivivisectionists are the second of the two types Theodore Roosevelt described when he said, 'Common sense without conscience may lead to crime, but conscience without common sense may lead to folly, which is the handmaiden of crime.'\" These divisions between pro- and anti-animal testing groups first came to public attention during the Brown Dog affair in the early 1900s, when hundreds of medical students clashed with anti-vivisectionists and police over a memorial to a vivisected dog.\nIn 1822, the first animal protection law was enacted in the British parliament, followed by the Cruelty to Animals Act (1876), the first law specifically aimed at regulating animal testing. The legislation was promoted by Charles Darwin, who wrote to Ray Lankester in March 1871: \"You ask about my opinion on vivisection. I quite agree that it is justifiable for proper investigations on physiology; but not for mere damnable and detestable curiosity. It is a subject which makes me sick with horror, so I will not say another word about it, else I shall not sleep to-night.\" In response to the lobbying by anti-vivisectionists, several organizations were set up in Britain to defend animal research: The Physiological Society was formed in 1876 to give physiologists \"mutual benefit and protection\", the Association for the Advancement of Medicine by Research was formed in 1882 and focused on policy-making, and the Research Defence Society (now Understanding Animal Research) was formed in 1908 \"to make known the facts as to experiments on animals in this country; the immense importance to the welfare of mankind of such experiments and the great saving of human life and health directly attributable to them\".\nOpposition to the use of animals in medical research first arose in the United States during the 1860s, when Henry Bergh founded the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA), with America's first specifically anti-vivisection organization being the American AntiVivisection Society (AAVS), founded in 1883. Antivivisectionists of the era generally believed the spread of mercy was the great cause of civilization, and vivisection was cruel. However, in the USA the antivivisectionists' efforts were defeated in every legislature, overwhelmed by the superior organization and influence of the medical community. Overall, this movement had little legislative success until the passing of the Laboratory Animal Welfare Act, in 1966.\nReal progress in thinking about animal rights build on the \"theory of justice\" (1971) by the philosopher John Rawls and work on ethics by philosopher Peter Singer.", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing"}

The \"Three Rs\" are guiding principles for the use of animals in research in most countries. Whilst replacement of animals, i.e. alternatives to animal testing, is one of the principles, their scope is much broader. Although such principles have been welcomed as a step forwards by some animal welfare groups, they have also been criticized as both outdated by current research, and of little practical effect in improving animal welfare. The scientists and engineers at Harvard's Wyss Institute have created \"organs-on-a-chip\", including the \"lung-on-a-chip\" and \"gut-on-a-chip\". Researchers at cellasys in Germany developed a \"skin-on-a-chip\". These tiny devices contain human cells in a 3-dimensional system that mimics human organs. The chips can be used instead of animals in in vitro disease research, drug testing, and toxicity testing. Researchers have also begun using 3-D bioprinters to create human tissues for in vitro testing.\nAnother non-animal research method is in silico or computer simulation and mathematical modeling which seeks to investigate and ultimately predict toxicity and drug effects on humans without using animals. This is done by investigating test compounds on a molecular level using recent advances in technological capabilities with the ultimate goal of creating treatments unique to each patient. Microdosing is another alternative to the use of animals in experimentation. Microdosing is a process whereby volunteers are administered a small dose of a test compound allowing researchers to investigate its pharmacological affects without harming the volunteers. Microdosing can replace the use of animals in pre-clinical drug screening and can reduce the number of animals used in safety and toxicity testing. Additional alternative methods include positron emission tomography (PET), which allows scanning of the human brain in vivo, and comparative epidemiological studies of disease risk factors among human populations. Simulators and computer programs have also replaced the use of animals in dissection, teaching and training exercises.\nOfficial bodies such as the European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Test Methods of the European Commission, the Interagency Coordinating Committee for the Validation of Alternative Methods in the US, ZEBET in Germany, and the Japanese Center for the Validation of Alternative Methods (among others) also promote and disseminate the 3Rs. These bodies are mainly driven by responding to regulatory requirements, such as supporting the cosmetics testing ban in the EU by validating alternative methods. The European Partnership for Alternative Approaches to Animal Testing serves as a liaison between the European Commission and industries. The European Consensus Platform for Alternatives coordinates efforts amongst EU member states. Academic centers also investigate alternatives, including the Center for Alternatives to Animal Testing at the Johns Hopkins University and the NC3Rs in the UK.", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing"}

Mallards and other ducks are particularly susceptible, as they often resort to poor food sources during bad weather. Captive raptors, such as falcons and hawks, are susceptible to this disease if they are kept in poor conditions and especially if they are fed pigeons, which are often carriers of \"asper\". It can be acute in chicks, but chronic in mature birds.\nIn the United States, aspergillosis has been the culprit in several rapid die-offs among waterfowl.  From 8 December until 14 December 2006, over 2,000 mallards died near Burley, Idaho, an agricultural community about 150 miles southeast of Boise.  Mouldy waste grain from the farmland and feedlots in the area is the suspected source.  A similar aspergillosis outbreak caused by mouldy grain killed 500 mallards in Iowa in 2005.\nWhile no connection has been found between aspergillosis and the H5N1 strain of avian influenza (commonly called \"bird flu\"), rapid die-offs caused by aspergillosis can spark fears of bird flu outbreaks.  Laboratory analysis is the only way to distinguish bird flu from aspergillosis.\nIn dogs, aspergillosis is an uncommon disease typically affecting only the nasal passages (nasal aspergillosis). This is much more common in dolicocephalic breeds. It can also spread to the rest of the body; this is termed disseminated aspergillosis and is rare, usually affecting individuals with underlying immune disorders.\nIn 2019, an outbreak of aspergillosis struck the rare kākāpō, a large flightless parrot endemic to New Zealand. By June the disease had killed seven of the birds, whose total population at the time was only 142 adults and 72 chicks.

Being female is the single greatest risk factor for developing autoimmune disease than any other genetic or environmental risk factor yet discovered. Autoimmune conditions overrepresented in women include: lupus, primary biliary cholangitis, Graves' disease, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, and multiple sclerosis, among many others. A few autoimmune diseases that men are just as or more likely to develop as women include: ankylosing spondylitis, type 1 diabetes mellitus, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, and psoriasis.\nThe reasons for the sex role in autoimmunity vary. Women appear to generally mount larger inflammatory responses than men when their immune systems are triggered, increasing the risk of autoimmunity. Involvement of sex steroids is indicated by that many autoimmune diseases tend to fluctuate in accordance with hormonal changes, for example: during pregnancy, in the menstrual cycle, or when using oral contraception. A history of pregnancy also appears to leave a persistent increased risk for autoimmune disease. It has been suggested that the slight, direct exchange of cells between mothers and their children during pregnancy may induce autoimmunity. This would tip the gender balance in the direction of the female.\nAnother theory suggests the female high tendency to get autoimmunity is due to an imbalanced X-chromosome inactivation.

Babesiosis may be suspected when a person with such an exposure history develops persistent fevers and hemolytic anemia. The definitive diagnostic test is the identification of parasites on a Giemsa-stained thin-film blood smear.\nSo-called \"Maltese cross formations\" on the blood film are diagnostic (pathognomonic) of babesiosis since they are not seen in malaria, the primary differential diagnosis. Careful examination of multiple smears may be necessary, since Babesia may infect less than 1% of circulating red blood cells, thus be easily overlooked.\nSerologic testing for antibodies against Babesia (both IgG and IgM) can detect low-level infection in cases with high clinical suspicion, but negative blood film examinations. Serology is also useful for differentiating babesiosis from malaria in cases where people are at risk for both infections. Since detectable antibody responses require about a week after infection to develop, serologic testing may be falsely negative early in the disease course.\nA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test has been developed for the detection of Babesia from the peripheral blood. PCR may be at least as sensitive and specific as blood-film examination in diagnosing babesiosis, though it is also significantly more expensive. Most often, PCR testing is used in conjunction with blood film examination and possibly serologic testing.\nOther laboratory findings include decreased numbers of red blood cells and platelets on complete blood count.\nIn animals, babesiosis is suspected by observation of clinical signs (hemoglobinuria and anemia) in animals in endemic areas. Diagnosis is confirmed by observation of merozoites on a thin film blood smear examined at maximum magnification under oil using Romonovski stains (methylene blue and eosin). This is a routine part of the veterinary examination of dogs and ruminants in regions where babesiosis is endemic.\nBabesia canis and B. bigemina are \"large Babesia species\" that form paired merozoites in the erythrocytes, commonly described as resembling \"two pears hanging together\", rather than the \"Maltese cross\" of the \"small Babesia species\". Their merozoites are around twice the size of small ones.\nCerebral babesiosis is suspected in vivo when neurological signs (often severe) are seen in cattle that are positive for B. bovis on blood smear, but this has yet to be proven scientifically.

Although antibodies against Babesia canis were detected in horses in one study, the infection does not cause any clinical symptoms in these animals and is self-limiting. Nine genetically distinct species of Babesia are now known to infect dogs.\nBabesia canis (Piana & Galli-Valerio, 1895) is a relatively large species of Babesia (2–4 × 4–7 μm) that occurs worldwide.

This Babesia subspecies is the most common cause of disease in dogs in German-speaking countries. Originally found only in North Africa, northern and central Italy, France, and the southern parts of Hungary and Austria (\"Mediterranean disease\"), it now has natural foci in Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and Poland. The pathogen is highly virulent. There are two strains. The French strain originates from the northern and eastern Mediterranean region and is now also found in some south-western regions of Germany. The Hungarian strain occurs mainly in the Balkans and Ukraine but is now also found in some regions of eastern Germany.\nBabesia canis vogeli is transmitted by the brown dog tick (Rhipicephalus sanguineus). Infections with this pathogen are rare in Central Europe and are mild. B. c. vogeli is widespread in North Africa, the Mediterranean region, and France.\nBabesia canis rossi is spread by Haemaphysalis elliptica and only occurs in Africa south of the Sahara. The pathogen is the most virulent species of Babesia.\nIn more recent studies, these three large Babesia species are also counted as separate species, and there are two further isolates (North Carolina isolate and Great Britain isolate) that indicate the existence of further large Babesia species.\nBabesia gibsoni (Patton, 1910) is another species of Babesia found in dogs. It is smaller (1.1–2 × 1.2–4 μm) and therefore also morphologically distinguishable from B. canis. The pathogen is mainly found in Asia and the United States, with a distinction being made between an Asian and a California genotype. It is transmitted by ticks of the genera Haemaphysalis (Haemaphysalis spinosa) and Rhipicephalus. In 2007, two locally acquired infections with the Asian genotype were reported in Germany for the first time. A recent study suggests that the \"small Babesia\" of the California genotype should be classified as a separate species, Babesia conradae. The species Babesia vulpes (formerly Theileria annae), also classified as a \"small Babesia\", primarily infects foxes and occurs in the Pyrenees and North America. Isolated cases have also been reported in dogs in Germany. Its vector is probably the hedgehog tick (Ixodes hexagonus).\nThe first evidence of the disease was found in the USA in 1934. However, there were already reports of canine diseases in Italy in 1895 and in Africa in 1896 that pointed to babesiosis. Until the 1970s, the original distribution area of babesiosis (enzootic area) within Europe was limited to southern Europe, meaning that the disease occurred in Germany almost exclusively in dogs returning from holidays in this region (\"Mediterranean disease\"). The first Babesia vulpes infection was detected in Germany in 2000 in a dog originating from northern Spain. With the spread of the castor bean tick throughout Central Europe, local cases of disease are also occurring in Germany: around a third of dogs that have fallen ill have never been abroad. Although the infection rate of castor bean ticks with Babesia is still relatively low in Germany, it is steadily increasing. Around 0.5% of castor bean ticks are carriers of Babesia. After initially only localised infections were observed in the Upper Rhine region, there are now enzootic areas in Saarland, Rhineland-Palatinate, the Isar floodplains near Munich, the area around Regensburg, the Elbe floodplains, and Brandenburg. Currently, several thousand cases are reported in Germany each year.

Under experimental conditions, transmission of B. c. canis has been detected as early as 12 hours after the tick has attached itself. When the tick attaches itself to the host, the sporozoites dormant in various organs are activated by irritation of the nervous system and develop into kinetes, which then migrate to the salivary glands and enter the dog's bloodstream with the tick's saliva. In addition to transmission by ticks, infection can also be transmitted from dog to dog via blood transfusion or blood-to-blood contact, for example, during fights. Transmission from the mother to her offspring (\"vertical infection\") is also suspected and has been proven for B. gibsoni.\nThe sporozoites invade the red blood cells (erythrocytes) of dogs and undergo a phase of asexual reproduction (merogony). The resulting developmental stages (known as merozoites) damage the erythrocytes, are released after their destruction, and can then invade new, uninfected erythrocytes. In response to the infection, the organism initially shows an acute phase reaction with an increase in C-reactive protein and fibrinogen, a thrombocyte and leukocyte decrease, and a drop in blood pressure. This is followed by an immune response with the formation of IgG and IgM antibodies. However, the pathogen is not completely eliminated by the dog's immune system, meaning that these animals represent a constant source of infection (pathogen reservoir) and thus ensure that the infection cycle is maintained.\nTicks ingest the infected erythrocytes when they feed. In the tick's intestine, the merozoites develop into sexual Babesia stages (gametocytes and gametes). These differentiate into kinetes, which penetrate the eggs inside the tick's ovaries and thus pass on the pathogen to the tick's offspring (transovarial transmission). This transovarial transmission means that not only adult ticks but also nymphs are carriers of Babesia. In addition, the kinetes migrate to the salivary glands of the tick, where they differentiate into sporozoites that are infectious to dogs.", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babesiosis_of_dogs"}

One to two days later, the breakdown of red blood cells (haemolysis) leads to anaemia, blood in the urine, excretion of the blood pigment breakdown product bilirubin in the urine (bilirubinuria), and, in some cases, jaundice. Liver and spleen enlargement are common. In severe cases, ascites and water retention (oedema) occur, as well as bleeding of the skin and mucous membranes due to a lack of blood platelets (thrombocytopenia) and blood clotting within the blood vessels (disseminated intravascular coagulopathy). Inflammation of the mouth (stomatitis) and stomach lining (gastritis), as well as the muscles (myositis), is common. A \"central nervous system form\" with epilepsy-like seizures, movement disorders, and paralysis is also possible. If left untreated, the acute form ends within a few days with death from respiratory distress, anaemia, and kidney failure, which is a feared complication of babesiosis.

In the classic natural foci of Babesia canis canis (southern Austria, Hungary, northern Italy), young animals are generally protected by antibodies from the bitch's first milk (colostrum) due to high infection rates. They develop extensive protection through primary latency and become immune carriers.

The diagnosis can be made using a normal blood smear (\"thin drop\") or the so-called \"thick drop\", whereby capillary blood is more sensitive than venous blood. In the early stages of infection and between periods of rapid reproduction in the blood (parasitaemia), the pathogens may only be present in small numbers and therefore be overlooked. Reliable detection in a blood smear is only possible around seven days after infection. Babesia can be detected under a microscope, with Giemsa staining being the most reliable method, unlike the usual rapid staining methods. B. canis appears as pear-shaped structures arranged in pairs or larger groups in a rosette pattern in the red blood cells, while B. gibsoni appears as ring-shaped structures. Reliable PCR detection of the pathogen's DNA is possible as early as 3 to 5 days after infection.\nSerological tests, such as the immunofluorescence antibody test and the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) are not useful in acute cases, as the animals have not yet produced any antibodies. Antibodies can be detected as early as 10 days after infection. In chronic cases, cyclical changes in antibody levels occur.\nIf a blood test shows a leukocyte count < 7,250/μL, a thrombocyte count < 55,000/μL, and a reticulocyte count < 61,600/μL, babesiosis should always be considered if the preliminary report indicates this, and direct detection of the pathogen should be attempted.

Antiprotozoal drugs such as imidocarb or diminazene are effective against B. canis, but only slightly effective against \"small Babesia\". Imidocarb can also be administered once as a pro prophylactic measure when travelling to endemic areas – protection lasts for around three weeks. A combination of atovaquone and azithromycin can also cure chronic infections with B. gibsoni. This combination can also be used against B. canis if resistance to imidocarb develops or if there are recurrences. Phenamidine is also effective against \"small Babesia\", but is currently not available in Germany. In acute cases, a blood transfusion or the administration of haemoglobin glutamer 200 is indicated if the haematocrit is below 20. Treatment with imidocarb varies depending on the region. In the original endemic areas, it is administered once at a low dose to suppress the acute disease but not completely eliminate the pathogen, allowing the development of long-lasting immunity. In non-endemic regions, however, the active ingredient is administered twice at a higher dose. This completely eradicates the pathogen, but the resulting immunity only lasts for 1 to 2 years. There are currently no valid guidelines for treating seropositive dogs without symptoms of disease. Based on current knowledge, treatment of such dogs is not indicated if the PCR test is negative. However, treatment should be considered in animals with a removed spleen or immunosuppressed.\nThe most important preventative measure is to check your pet for ticks after every walk and remove them immediately. Protection against ticks using external tick-killing agents (acaricides such as deltamethrin, flumethrin, or permethrin) or oral acaricides such as fluralaner or afoxolaner is advisable, as these also reduce the risk of other diseases transmitted by ticks to dogs, such as Lyme disease, ehrlichiosis or hepatozoonosis.\nA vaccine against B. c. canis and B. c. rossi (trade name Nobivac Piro) was available from 2004 onwards. Although it did not protect against infection, it significantly alleviated the disease. It had to be administered every six months after two initial immunisations. The Standing Committee on Vaccination in Veterinary Medicine did not recommend its general use. In 2012, EU approval expired at the manufacturer's request, meaning that vaccination is no longer possible.", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babesiosis_of_dogs"}
{"condition": "Benign prostatic hyperplasia", "species": "mixed", "section": "unlabelled", "paragraph_id": 2, "text": "Causes\nHormones\nMost experts consider androgens (testosterone and related hormones) to play a permissive role in the development of BPH. This means that androgens must be present for BPH to occur, but do not necessarily directly cause the condition. This is supported by evidence suggesting that castrated boys do not develop BPH when they age. In a study of 26 eunuchs from the palace of the Qing dynasty still living in Beijing in 1960, the prostate could not be felt in 81% of the studied eunuchs. The average time since castration was 54 years (range, 41–65 years). On the other hand, some studies suggest that administering exogenous testosterone is not associated with a significant increase in the risk of BPH symptoms, so the role of testosterone in prostate cancer and BPH is still unclear. Further randomized controlled trials with more participants are needed to quantify any risk of giving exogenous testosterone.\nDihydrotestosterone (DHT), a metabolite of testosterone, is a critical mediator of prostatic growth. DHT is synthesized in the prostate from circulating testosterone by the action of the enzyme 5α-reductase, type 2. DHT can act in an autocrine fashion on the stromal cells or in paracrine fashion by diffusing into nearby epithelial cells. In both of these cell types, DHT binds to nuclear androgen receptors and signals the transcription of growth factors that are mitogenic to the epithelial and stromal cells. DHT is ten times more potent than testosterone because it dissociates from the androgen receptor more slowly. The importance of DHT in causing nodular hyperplasia is supported by clinical observations in which an inhibitor of 5α-reductase such as finasteride is given to men with this condition. Therapy with a 5α-reductase inhibitor markedly reduces the DHT content of the prostate and, in turn, reduces prostate volume and BPH symptoms.\nTestosterone promotes prostate cell proliferation, but relatively low levels of serum testosterone are found in patients with BPH. One small study has shown that medical castration lowers the serum and prostate hormone levels unevenly, having less effect on testosterone and DHT levels in the prostate.\nBesides testosterone and DHT, other androgens are also known to play a crucial role in BPH development. C21 11-oxygenated steroids (pregnanes) have been identified are precursors to 11-oxygenated androgens which are also potent agonists for the androgen receptor. Specifically, steroids like 11β-hydroxyprogesterone and 11-ketoprogesterone can be converted to 11-ketodihydrotestosterone, an 11-oxo form of DHT with the same potency. These precursors have also been detected in tissue biopsy samples from patients with BPH, as well as in their serum levels. Besides that, androgens biosynthesized via a backdoor pathway can contribute to the development of BPH.\nWhile there is some evidence that estrogen may play a role in the cause of BPH, this effect appears to be mediated mainly through local conversion of androgens to estrogen in the prostate tissue rather than a direct effect of estrogen itself. In canine in vivo studies castration, which significantly reduced androgen levels but left estrogen levels unchanged, caused significant atrophy of the prostate. Studies looking for a correlation between prostatic hyperplasia and serum estrogen levels in humans have generally shown none.\nIn 2008, Gat et al. published evidence that BPH is caused by failure in the spermatic venous drainage system resulting in increased hydrostatic pressure and local testosterone levels elevated more than 100-fold above serum levels. If confirmed, this mechanism explains why serum androgen levels do not seem to correlate with BPH and why giving exogenous testosterone would not make much difference.", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benign_prostatic_hyperplasia"}

Urate stones make up about six percent of all stones in the cat.\nUrate stones can be dissolved using a diet with reduced purines that alkalinizes and dilutes the urine. Allopurinol is used in dogs with altered purine metabolism to prevent the formation of uric acid. Feeding a diet high in purines while simultaneously administering allopurinol can result in the formation of xanthine (C5H4N4O2) stones.", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bladder_stone_(animal)"}

Some stones, including struvite and urate stones, can be dissolved using dietary modifications and/or medications. Calcium oxalate stones are insoluble and must be surgically removed. Small stones in female dogs may possibly be removed by urohydropropulsion, a nonsurgical procedure. Urohydropropulsion is performed under sedation by filling the bladder with saline through a catheter, holding the dog vertically, and squeezing the bladder to expel the stones through the urethra. Bladder stones can be removed surgically by a cystotomy, which is a small incision into the bladder to scoop out the stones. Stones lodged in the urethra can often be flushed into the bladder and removed, but sometimes a urethrotomy is necessary. In male dogs with recurrent urinary tract obstruction a scrotal urethrostomy creates a permanent opening in the urethra proximal to the area where most stones lodge, behind the os penis. In male cats, stones lodge where the urethra narrows in the penis. Recurrent cases can be treated surgically with a perineal urethrostomy, which removes the penis and creates a new opening for the urethra.\nTo prevent recurrence of stones, special diets can be used for each type of stone.

Prediction of disease risk and prevention of disease are both made extraordinarily difficult by our very poor understanding of where and how this organism normally grows in nature. Despite decades of attempts at isolating organisms from epidemiological foci, B. dermatitidis has only been isolated from the environment 21 times. Most of these isolations have been based on the arduous isolation techniques involving the suspension of soil or other environmental materials in aqueous medium with antibacterial antibiotics, and injection of mice with these materials, followed by sacrifice of the animals when they appear ill or at the end of six weeks. The internal organs of the mice are then checked microscopically for evidence of blastomycosis. Needless to say, the cost and complexity of performing such studies is imposing, especially as the ethical clearance procedures for work involving animals become ever more involved. More direct and economical mycological techniques for environmental isolation, such as dilution plating, have never yielded positive results for Blastomyces growth. Since B. dermatitidis will grow readily from clinical samples on common laboratory media, the lack of success in isolating it from environmental materials is generally ascribed to the inhibitory effects of co-occurring common molds and antibiotic-resistant bacteria.\nIn just one experiment, a single positive B. dermatitidis culture was gained via use of a novel enrichment broth technique. Recently, in an important breakthrough, a specific PCR technique was developed that was able to detect B. dermatitidis in three environmental samples from a dog kennel that had been experiencing problems with blastomycosis.\nWhat has been learned from direct isolation and recent PCR studies is that B. dermatitidis tends to be associated with soils and wood debris in areas \"characterized by an acidic pH, high organic content (due to rotting or decayed wood or vegetation and animal or bird droppings), abundant moisture, and proximity to waterways\". Recent PCR detections, for example, concerned a Kentucky dog kennel where 35 of 100 dogs had contracted blastomycosis. Previous isolations have been from comparable sites such as soil and wood debris from an abandoned Wisconsin beaver dam, and woody materials from a Wisconsin woodpile. Isolation of B. dermatitidis was also accomplished from an earthen floor indoors on one occasion.\nThere has been a long history of justifiable speculation that B. dermatitidis may associate in nature with one or more indigenous North American mammalian host species. To date, however, all the animal species that have been subjected to focused investigation have been exonerated of this specific connection. Unsubstantiated suspicion has particularly focused on the beaver, but the shrew, the bat and the prairie dog have also been focal points of interest, with no conclusive interspecies association being demonstrated to date. The closely related pathogenic fungus P. brasiliensis in South America has a well substantiated, though not well understood, ecological link with the nine-banded armadillo, Dasypus novemcinctus.

Around half of the people with the disease have symptoms, which can include fever, cough, night sweats, muscle pains, weight loss, chest pain, and fatigue. Symptoms usually develop between three weeks and three months after breathing in the spores. In 25% to 40% of cases, the infection also spreads to other parts of the body, such as the skin, bones, or central nervous system. Although blastomycosis is especially dangerous for those with weak immune systems, most people diagnosed with blastomycosis have healthy immune systems.\nBlastomyces dermatitidis is found in the soil and decaying organic matter like wood or leaves. Outdoor activities like hunting or camping in wooded areas increase the risk of developing blastomycosis. There is no vaccine, but the risk of the disease can be reduced by not disturbing the soil. Treatment is typically with an azole drug such as itraconazole for mild or moderate disease. In severe cases, patients are treated with amphotericin B before azole treatment. In either event, the azole treatment lasts for 6–12 months. Overall, 4–6% of people who develop blastomycosis die; however, if the central nervous system is involved, this rises to 18%. People with AIDS or on medications that suppress the immune system have the highest risk of death at 25–40%.\nBlastomycosis is endemic to the eastern United States and Canada, especially the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys, the Great Lakes, and the St. Lawrence River valley. In these areas, there are about 1 to 2 cases per 100,000 per year. Less frequently, blastomycosis also occurs in Africa, the Middle East, India, and western North America. Blastomycosis also affects a broad range of non-human mammals, and dogs in particular are an order of magnitude more likely to contract the disease than humans. The ecological niche of Blastomyces in the wild is poorly understood, and it is unknown if there are any significant host animals.\nBlastomycosis has existed for millions of years but was first described by Thomas Caspar Gilchrist in 1894.

Manitoba is calculated at 0.62 cases per 100,000. Remarkably higher incidence was shown for the Kenora, Ontario region: 117 per 100,000 overall, with Aboriginal reserve communities experiencing 404.9 per 100,000. In the United States, the incidence of blastomycosis is similarly high in hyperendemic areas. For example, the city of Eagle River, Vilas County, Wisconsin, has an incidence rate of 101.3 per 100,000; the county as a whole has been shown in two successive studies to have an incidence of about 40 cases per 100,000.

Some of these relate to the ongoing effort to understand the source of the infectious inoculum of this species, while others relate to which groups of people are especially likely to become infected. Human blastomycosis is primarily associated with forested areas and open watersheds; It primarily affects otherwise healthy, vigorous people, mostly middle-aged, who acquire the disease while working or undertaking recreational activities in sites conventionally considered clean, healthy and in many cases beautiful.

The pathogenic group of onygenalean fungi that give rise to conditions including blastomycosis and histoplasmosis emerged approximately 150 million years ago. The most closely related blastomycosis-causing fungi, Blastomyces dermatitidis and Blastomyces gilchristii, diverged during the Pleistocene, approximately 1.9 million years ago.\nAt the Koster Site in Illinois, evidence pointing to possible blastomycosis infections among Late Woodland Native Americans has been identified. At that site, Dr. Jane Buikstra found evidence for what may have been an epidemic of a serious spinal disease in adolescents and young adults. Several of the skeletons showed lesions in the spinal vertebrae in the lower back. Two modern diseases produce lesions in the bone similar to the ones Dr. Buikstra found in these prehistoric specimens: spinal tuberculosis and blastomycosis. The bony lesions in these two diseases are practically identical. Blastomycosis seems more probable as these young people in Late Woodland and Mississippian times may have been affected because they were spending more time cultivating plants than their Middle Woodland predecessors had done. If true, it would be another severe penalty Late Woodland people had to pay as they shifted to agriculture as a way of life, and it would be a contributing factor to shortening their lifespans compared to those of the Middle Woodland people.\nBlastomycosis was first described by Thomas Caspar Gilchrist in 1894, as a skin disease. Because of this, blastomycosis is sometimes called \"Gilchrist's disease\". Gilchrist initially identified the cause of the disease as a protozoan, but later correctly identified it as a fungus. In 1898, he and William Royal Stokes published the first description of Blastomyces dermatitidis. Gilchrist referred to the disease as \"blastomycetic dermatitis\".\nThe systemic spread of blastomycosis was first described in 1902, in a case that had been misdiagnosed as a combination of tuberculosis and a blastomycosis skin infection. In 1907, the dimorphic nature of the Blastomyces fungus was first identified. In 1912, the first case of canine blastomycosis was reported.\nPrior to the 1930s, blastomycosis was not clearly distinguished from similar fungal conditions. A paper by Rhoda Williams Benham in 1934 distinguished the causative agent of blastomycosis from cryptococcosis and coccidioidomycosis.\nIn the early 1950s, blastomycosis was first determined to be a primarily respiratory disease, with most skin lesions caused by systemic spread from an initial lung infection. In 1952, the first documented case outside North or Central America, in Tunisia, was reported. The 1950s also saw the first introduction of antifungal drugs including amphotericin B. Before 1950, the fatality rate for disseminated blastomycosis was 92%, and treatment options were limited to iodide compounds, radiation therapy, and surgery. The first azole antifungal drug, ketoconazole, was developed in the 1970s and approved in the United States in 1981.\nBefore 2013, the only species known to cause blastomycosis was B. dermatitidis. Since that time, genomic analysis has identified multiple other Blastomyces species causing blastomycosis, including B. gilchristii (2013), B. helicus (reassigned from the genus Emmonsia in 2017), B. percursus (2017), and B. emzantsi (2020).\nThe largest-ever blastomycosis outbreak in United States history occurred at an Escanaba, Michigan, paper mill in 2023.

One point of view is that certain dog breeds are a public safety issue that merits actions such as banning ownership, mandatory spaying/neutering for all dogs of these breeds, mandatory microchip implants and liability insurance, or prohibiting people convicted of a felony from owning them. Another point of view is that comprehensive \"dog bite\" legislation, coupled with better consumer education and legally mandating responsible pet keeping practices, is a better solution than breed-specific legislation to the problem of dangerous dogs.\nA third point of view is that breed-specific legislation should not ban breeds entirely, but should strictly regulate the conditions under which specific breeds could be owned, e.g., forbidding certain classes of individuals from owning them, specifying public areas in which they would be prohibited, and establishing conditions, such as requiring a dog to wear a muzzle, for taking dogs from specific breeds into public places.

This analysis requires that the law being challenged must be rationally related to a legitimate government goal or purpose. Because state and local jurisdictions enjoy broad police powers, including protecting the public's safety and welfare, courts have not had trouble finding that BSL is rationally related to the goal of protecting the public from allegedly dangerous breeds.\nThis has caused big problems for many who use them as police, guide or other service dogs, as they are not always excluded, and in some cases are confiscated and put down.\nChallenges based on equal protection arguments are similarly difficult to sustain. Here courts are looking at whether there is a rational purpose for treating pit bull breeds differently from other dog breeds. Dog owners have attacked the rational purpose requirement by arguing either that BSL is over-inclusive, because it bans all dogs of a breed when only certain individuals within the breed have proven to be vicious, or under-inclusive, because many types of dogs have injured people and the BSL fails to include those other breeds.

{"condition": "Breed-specific legislation", "species": "dog", "section": "unlabelled", "paragraph_id": 42, "text": "{¶ 30} The court of appeals found R.C. 955.11 and 955.22 and Toledo Municipal Code 505.14 unconstitutional with respect to procedural due process, substantive due process, and equal protection, and under the void-for-vagueness doctrine. We disagree.\n{¶ 31} First, the court of appeals declared that the laws violated procedural due process pursuant to State v. Cowan, 103 Ohio St.3d 144, 2004-Ohio-4777, 814 N.E.2d 846. In Cowan, a Portage County deputy dog warden determined two dogs to be vicious following a complaint that the dogs had attacked a woman. Id. at ¶ 1. The dogs were determined to be vicious because of the alleged attack, not because they were pit bulls. We held that when a dog is determined to be \"vicious\" under R.C. 955.11(A)(4)(a), procedural due process requires that the owner have notice and an opportunity to be heard before the owner is charged with a crime. Id. at ¶ 13.\n{¶ 32} In Cowan, the dogs were determined to be vicious under the first two subsections of R.C. 955.11(A)(4)(a) because they had caused injury to a person. Thus, the case concerned the dog warden's unilateral classification of the dogs as vicious. However, in this case, the \"vicious dogs\" at issue are those classified as pit bulls under the third subsection of R.C. 955.11(A)(4)(a). Unlike the situation in Cowan, the General Assembly has classified pit bulls generally as vicious; there is no concern about unilateral administrative decision-making on a case-by-case basis. The clear statutory language alerts all owners of pit bulls that failure to abide by the laws related to vicious dogs and pit bulls is a crime. Therefore, the laws do not violate the rights of pit bull owners to procedural due process.\n{¶ 33} Second, R.C. 955.11 and 955.22 and Toledo Municipal Code 505.14 are not unconstitutional for violating substantive due process or equal protection rights. Laws limiting rights, other than fundamental rights, are constitutional with respect to substantive due process and equal protection if the laws are rationally related to a legitimate goal of government. See State v. Thompkins (1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 558, 560–561, 664 N.E.2d 926. As we discussed previously when evaluating whether the statutes and ordinance in question are valid exercises of state and city police power, R.C. 955.11 and 955.22 January Term, 2007 and Toledo Municipal Code 505.14 are rationally related to a legitimate government interest.\n{¶ 34} Finally, the court of appeals erred in holding that R.C. 955.11 and 955.22 and Toledo Municipal Code 505.14 are void for vagueness. This court has previously held that the term \"pit bull\" is not unconstitutionally void for vagueness. In State v. Anderson, we stated: \"In sum, we believe that the physical and behavioral traits of pit bulls together with the commonly available knowledge of dog breeds typically acquired by potential dog owners or otherwise possessed by veterinarians or breeders are sufficient to inform a dog owner as to whether he owns a dog commonly known as a pit bull dog.\" 57 Ohio St.3d 168, 173, 566 N.E.2d 1224.\n{¶ 35} In conclusion, the state and the city of Toledo possess the constitutional authority to exercise police powers that are rationally related to a legitimate interest in public health, safety, morals, or general welfare. Here, evidence proves that pit bulls cause more damage than other dogs when they attack, cause more fatalities in Ohio than other dogs, and cause Toledo police officers to fire their weapons more often than people or other breeds of dogs cause them to fire their weapons. We hold that the state of Ohio and the city of Toledo have a legitimate interest in protecting citizens from the dangers associated with pit bulls, and that R.C. 955.11(A)(4)(a)(iii) and 955.22 and Toledo Municipal Code 505.14 are rationally related to that interest and are constitutional.\nMr. Tellings appealed the case to the Supreme Court of the United States, which declined to hear the case.", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breed-specific_legislation"}

CDV does not affect humans.\nIn canines, CDV affects several body systems, including the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts, the spinal cord, and the brain. Common symptoms include high fever, eye inflammation and eye/nose discharge, labored breathing and coughing, vomiting and diarrhea, loss of appetite and lethargy, and hardening of the nose and footpads. The viral infection can be accompanied by secondary bacterial infections and can eventually present serious neurological symptoms.\nCanine distemper is caused by a single-stranded RNA virus of the family Paramyxoviridae (the same family of viruses that causes measles, mumps, and bronchiolitis in humans). The disease is highly contagious via inhalation. Morbidity and mortality may vary greatly among animal species, with up to 100% mortality in unvaccinated populations of ferrets. In domestic dogs, while the acute generalized form of distemper has a high mortality rate, disease duration and severity depend mainly on the animal's age, immune status, and  the virulence of the infecting strain of the virus. Despite extensive vaccination in many regions, it remains a major disease in dogs and was the leading cause of infectious disease death in dogs prior to a vaccine becoming available.", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canine_distemper"}

Edward Jenner described the disease in 1809, and French veterinarian Henri Carré determined that the disease was caused by a virus in 1905. Carré's findings were disputed by researchers in England until 1926, when Patrick Laidlaw and G.W. Dunkin confirmed that the disease was, in fact, caused by a virus.\nThe first vaccine against canine distemper was developed by the Italian Vittorio Puntoni. In 1923 and 1924, Puntoni published two articles in which he added formalin to brain tissue from infected dogs to create a vaccine that successfully prevented the disease in healthy dogs. A commercial vaccine was developed in 1950, yet owing to its limited use, the virus remains prevalent in many populations.\nThe domestic dog has largely been responsible for introducing canine distemper to previously unexposed wildlife and now causes a serious conservation threat to many species of carnivores and some species of marsupials. The virus contributed to the near-extinction of the black-footed ferret. It also may have played a considerable role in the extinction of the thylacine (Tasmanian tiger) and recurrently causes mortality among African wild dogs. In 1993–1994, the lion population in the Serengeti, Tanzania, experienced a 20% decline as a result of the disease.

If neurological signs develop, incontinence may ensue. Central nervous system signs include a localized involuntary twitching of muscles or groups of muscles, seizures with salivation, and jaw movements commonly described as \"chewing-gum fits,\" or more appropriately as \"distemper myoclonus.\" As the condition progresses, the seizures worsen and progress to grand mal convulsions, followed by the death of the animal. The animal may also show signs of sensitivity to light, incoordination, circling, increased sensitivity to sensory stimuli such as pain or touch, and deterioration of motor capabilities. Less commonly, they may lead to blindness and paralysis. The length of the systemic disease may be as short as 10 days, or the start of neurological signs may not occur until several weeks or months later.

{"condition": "Canine distemper", "species": "dog", "section": "unlabelled", "paragraph_id": 8, "text": "Mechanism\nThe canine distemper virus affects nearly all body systems. Puppies from 3–6 months old are particularly susceptible. CDV spreads through aerosol droplets and through contact with infected bodily fluids, including nasal and ocular secretions, feces, and urine, 6 to 22 days after exposure. It can also be spread by food and water contaminated with these fluids. The time between infection and disease is 14 to 18 days, although a fever can appear from 3 to 6 days after infection.\nThe canine distemper virus tends to direct its infection toward the lymphoid, epithelial, and nervous tissues. The virus initially replicates in the lymphatic tissue of the respiratory tract.  The virus then enters the blood stream and infects the respiratory, gastrointestinal, urogenital, epithelial, and central nervous systems, as well as optic nerves. Therefore, the typical pathologic features of canine distemper include lymphoid depletion (causing immunosuppression and leading to secondary infections), interstitial pneumonia, encephalitis with demyelination, and hyperkeratosis of the nose and foot pads.\nThe virus first appears in bronchial lymph nodes and tonsils two days after exposure.  The virus then enters the bloodstream on the second or third day.  A first round of acute fever tends to begin around 3–8 days after infection, which is often accompanied by a low white blood cell count, especially of lymphocytes, as well as a low platelet count.  These signs may or may not be accompanied by anorexia, a runny nose, or discharge from the eye.  This first round of fever typically recedes rapidly within 96 hours, and then a second round of fever begins around the 11th or 12th day and lasts at least a week.  Gastrointestinal and respiratory problems tend to follow, which may become complicated with secondary bacterial infections.  Inflammation of the brain and spinal cord, otherwise known as encephalomyelitis, either is associated with this, subsequently follows, or comes completely independently of these problems. A thickening of the footpads sometimes develops, and vesicular pustular lesions on the abdomen usually develop. Neurological signs are typically found in animals with thickened footpads from the virus. About half of sufferers experience meningoencephalitis. Less than 50% of the adult dogs that contract the disease die from it. Among puppies, the death rate often reaches 80%.", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canine_distemper"}

However, several febrile diseases match many of the signs of the disease and only recently has distinguishing between canine hepatitis, herpes virus, parainfluenza, and leptospirosis been possible.  Thus, finding the virus by various methods in the dog's conjunctival cells or foot pads gives a definitive diagnosis.  In older dogs that develop distemper encephalomyelitis, diagnosis may be more difficult, since many of these dogs have an adequate vaccination history.\nAn additional test to confirm distemper is a brush border slide of the bladder transitional epithelium of the inside lining from the bladder, stained with Diff-Quik. These infected cells have inclusions which stain a carmine red color, found in the paranuclear cytoplasm. About 90% of the bladder cells will be positive for inclusions in the early stages of distemper.", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canine_distemper"}

Infected animals should be quarantined from other dogs for several months owing to the length of time the animal may shed the virus. The virus is destroyed in the environment by routine cleaning with disinfectants, detergents, or drying. It does not survive in the environment for more than a few hours at room temperature (20–25 °C), but can survive for a few weeks in shady environments at temperatures slightly above freezing. It, along with other labile viruses, can also persist longer in serum and tissue debris.\nDespite extensive vaccination in many regions, it remains a major disease of dogs.\nTo prevent canine distemper, puppies should begin vaccination at 6–8 weeks of age and then continue getting the \"booster shot\" every 2–4 weeks until they are 16 weeks of age. Without the full series of shots, the vaccination does not provide protection against the virus. Since puppies are typically sold at the age of 8–10 weeks, they typically receive the first shot while still with their breeder, but the new owner often does not finish the series.

It is collected from the liver cells via small channels that pass through the hepatic ducts and into the gallbladder. After a fatty meal the bile is then released into the small intestine promoted by a hormone called cholecystokinin that is present in the pancreas.\nThis is important for canines in terms of digestive health as the bile can facilitate in breaking down large fat particles into smaller ones.

The bile could also reveal more than one infection present, in this case a combination of medications is often given. To promote the excretion of excessive bile chloritic drugs can also be prescribed to manage the GBM.

These types of glaucoma are due to abnormalities in the structures of the eye which occurred during ocular development. One or both eyes may be affected.\nPrimary glaucomas occur in the absence of other eye disease, and are therefore presumed to be genetic in origin. The most common type of glaucoma in dogs is primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG). The least common type of glaucoma in dogs is primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), although this is the most common type that affects humans. In the Beagle, POAG is an inherited autosomal recessive trait.\nSecondary glaucomas occur when other eye diseases alter the flow of aqueous humor either into or out of the eye.", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canine_glaucoma"}

Symptoms include crying, weakness, depression, discharge from the nose, soft, yellow feces, and a loss of the sucking reflex.  CHV also causes a necrotizing vasculitis that results in hemorrhage around the blood vessels.  Bruising of the belly may occur.  Eye lesions include keratitis, uveitis, optic neuritis, retinitis, and retinal dysplasia.  There is a high mortality rate, approaching 80 percent in puppies less than one week old, and death usually occurs in one to two days.\nIn puppies three to five weeks old, the disease is less severe due to their ability to properly maintain body temperature and mount a febrile response. More puppies survive, but they can develop a latent infection, they can also develop petechial hemorrhages in the kidney due to vasculitis. Some later get neurologic disease and have symptoms like difficulty walking and blindness.

The exposure and transfer apparently occurred at horse-racing tracks, where dog racing had also occurred.  This was the first evidence of an influenza A virus causing disease in dogs.  However, serum collected from racing Greyhounds between 1984 and 2004 and tested for canine influenza virus (CIV) in 2007 had positive tests going as far back as 1999.  CIV possibly caused some of the respiratory disease outbreaks at tracks between 1999 and 2003.\nH3N8 was also responsible for a major dog-flu outbreak in New York state in all breeds of dogs. From January to May 2005, outbreaks occurred at 20 racetracks in 10 states (Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Kansas, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Texas, and West Virginia).  As of August 2006, dog flu has been confirmed in 22 U.S. states, including pet dogs in Wyoming, California, Connecticut, Delaware, and Hawaii.  Three areas in the United States may now be considered endemic for CIV due to continuous waves of cases: New York, southern Florida, and northern Colorado/southern Wyoming.  No evidence shows the virus can be transferred to people, cats, or other species.\nH5N1 (avian influenza) was also shown to cause death in one dog in Thailand, following ingestion of an infected duck.\nThe H3N2 virus made its first appearance in Canada at the start of 2018, following the importation of two unknowingly infected canines from South Korea. In 2006-2007 canine H3N2 first had reports in South Korea and was thought to be transferred to dogs from avian origins (avian influenza H3N2). It was not until 2015 that the canine H3N2 strain was discovered in the United States after there was an outbreak of dogs having respiratory infections in Chicago. As canine H3N2 influenza began to spread through the United States, in 2016 cats in an Indiana began to show symptoms of the disease as well, it is believed they were infected by coming in to contact with sick dogs.\nFollowing this incidence, reports of the virus possibly spreading, with two other canines reporting alarming symptoms, were made public. By March 5, 25 cases of infection were reportedly spread, although the number is thought to be closer to approximately 100.\nInfluenza A viruses are enveloped, negative sense, single-stranded RNA viruses.  Genome analysis has shown that H3N8 was transferred from horses to dogs and then adapted to dogs through point mutations in the genes.  The incubation period is two to five days, and viral shedding may occur for seven to ten days following the onset of symptoms.  It does not induce a persistent carrier state.\nIn late 2022, together with Bordetella bronchiseptica and other respiratory pathogens, the H3N2 canine flu virus experienced a surge in canine infections. This was partially due to increased human travel and reopened offices following the relaxation of COVID-19 pandemic public health measures, leading to large numbers of dogs being placed together in kennels and doggy day care centers. Changing pet ownership behaviors also led to overcrowded animal shelters, which had been emptied at the height of the pandemic.", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canine_influenza"}

Pancreatitis can be idiopathic; no real causation factor can be found. Obese  animals as well as animals fed a diet high in fat may be more prone to developing acute and chronic pancreatitis. Certain breeds of dogs are considered predisposed to developing pancreatitis including Miniature Schnauzers, Cocker Spaniels, and some terrier breeds. Miniature Schnauzers as a breed tend toward developing hyperlipidemia, an excess of circulating fats in the blood. The breed that appears to be at risk for the acute form of pancreatitis is the Yorkshire Terrier, while Labrador Retrievers and Miniature Poodles seem to have a decreased risk for the acute form of the disease.  Genetics may play a part in the risk factor. Certain cat breeds may have a predisposition. Dogs suffering from diabetes mellitus, Cushing's disease (hyperadrenocorticism), hypothyroidism, and epilepsy have been reported to have an increased risk but no there is a lack of evidence to support a link between the conditions and pancreatitis. Diabetes and hypothyroidism are also associated with hyperlipidemia. Those with other types of gastrointestinal conditions and dogs that have had previous pancreatitis attacks are also at increased risk for the disorder.\nIn cats, a study found an association with inflammatory bowel disease and cholangitis with pancreatitis. Triaditis is a medical condition/term for when a cat has all three conditions. 50–67% of cats with pancreatitis have triaditis. In cats with cholangitis 50–80% have pancreatitis.

There is no approved treatment, and the current standard of care is supportive care, involving extensive hospitalization, due to severe dehydration and potential damage to the intestines and bone marrow. A CPV test should be given as early as possible if CPV is suspected in order to begin early treatment and increase survival rate if the disease is found.\nSupportive care ideally also consists of crystalloid IV fluids and/or colloids (e.g., Hetastarch), antinausea injections (antiemetics) such as maropitant, metoclopramide, dolasetron, ondansetron and prochlorperazine, and broad-spectrum antibiotic injections such as cefazolin/enrofloxacin, ampicillin/enrofloxacin, metronidazole, timentin, or enrofloxacin. IV fluids are administered and antinausea and antibiotic injections are given subcutaneously, intramuscularly, or intravenously. The fluids are typically a mix of a sterile, balanced electrolyte solution, with an appropriate amount of B-complex vitamins, dextrose, and potassium chloride. Analgesic medications can be used to counteract the intestinal discomfort caused by frequent bouts of diarrhea; however, the use of opioid analgesics can result in secondary ileus and decreased motility.\nIn addition to fluids given to achieve adequate rehydration, each time the puppy vomits or has diarrhea in a significant quantity, an equal amount of fluid is administered intravenously. The fluid requirements of a patient are determined by the animal's body weight, weight changes over time, degree of dehydration at presentation, and surface area.\nA blood plasma transfusion from a donor dog that has already survived CPV is sometimes used to provide passive immunity to the sick dog. Some veterinarians keep these dogs on site, or have frozen serum available. There have been no controlled studies regarding this treatment. Additionally, fresh frozen plasma and human albumin transfusions can help replace the extreme protein losses seen in severe cases and help assure adequate tissue healing.

Oral antibiotics are administered for a number of days depending on the white blood cell count and the patient's ability to fight off secondary infection. A puppy with minimal symptoms can recover in two or three days if the IV fluids are begun as soon as symptoms are noticed and the CPV test confirms the diagnosis.

CPV2 causes the most serious disease and affects domesticated dogs and wild canids. There are variants of CPV2 called CPV-2a and CPV-2b, identified in 1979 and 1984 respectively. Most of canine parvovirus infection are believed to be caused by these two strains, which have replaced the original strain, and the present day virus is different from the one originally discovered, although they are indistinguishable by most routine tests. An additional variant is CPV-2c, a Glu-426 mutant, and was discovered in Italy, Vietnam, and Spain. The antigenic patterns of 2a and 2b are quite similar to the original CPV2. Variant 2c however has a unique pattern of antigenicity. This has led to claims of ineffective vaccination of dogs, but studies have shown that the existing CPV vaccines based on CPV-2b provide adequate levels of protection against CPV-2c. A strain of CPV-2b (strain FP84) has been shown to cause disease in a small percentage of domestic cats, although vaccination for FPV seems to be protective. With severe disease, dogs can die within 48 to 72 hours without treatment by fluids. In the more common, less severe form, mortality is about 10 percent. Certain breeds, such as Rottweilers, Doberman Pinschers, and Pit bull terriers as well as other black and tan colored dogs may be more susceptible to CPV2. Along with age and breed, factors such as a stressful environment, concurrent infections with bacteria, parasites, and canine coronavirus increase a dog's risk of severe infection. Dogs infected with parvovirus usually die from the dehydration it causes or secondary infection rather than the virus itself.\nThe variants of CPV-2 are defined by surface protein (VP capsid) features.

Following ingestion, the virus replicates in the lymphoid tissue in the throat, and then spreads to the bloodstream.

There is depletion of lymphocytes in lymph nodes and necrosis and destruction of the intestinal crypts. Anaerobic bacteria that normally reside in the intestines can then cross into the bloodstream, a process known as translocation, with  bacteremia leading to sepsis. The most common bacteria involved in severe cases are Clostridium, Campylobacter and Salmonella species. This can lead to a syndrome known as systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). SIRS leads to a range of complications such as hypercoagulability of the blood, endotoxaemia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Bacterial myocarditis has also been reported secondarily to sepsis. Dogs with CPV are at risk of intussusception, a condition where part of the intestine prolapses into another part.

CPV2 continues to evolve, and the success of new strains seems to depend on extending the range of hosts affected and improved binding to its receptor, the canine transferrin receptor.

In contrast, FPV seems to evolve only through random genetic drift.\nCPV2 affects dogs, wolves, foxes, and other canids. CPV2a and CPV2b have been isolated from a small percentage of symptomatic cats and is more common than feline panleukopenia in big cats.\nPreviously it has been thought that the virus does not undergo cross species infection. However studies in Vietnam have shown that CPV2 can undergo minor antigenic shift and natural mutation to infect felids. Analyses of feline parvovirus (FPV) isolates in Vietnam and Taiwan revealed that more than 80% of the isolates were of the canine parvovirus type, rather than feline panleukopenia virus (FPLV).

Every breed has their own cycle built into their genetics, making their time in heat unique to their own breed, therefore making crossbreeds open to new cycle lengths; 4-48 days in heat is confirmed to be the most accurately recorded range of times and proven to be the limits for the lengths of time for females to be in heat.   Females reach sexual maturity (puberty) as young as 3 months of age and rarely longer than 9 months for larger breeds. There is a tremendous variability in the maturation age between breeds, and even within a breed of dog.\n1. Proestrus, in which eggs in the ovaries begin to mature and estrogen levels begin to rise, is the first stage of the reproductive cycle. During this stage females, though non-receptive, attract males. Initial changes include swelling of the vulva lips, which become pliable, small amounts of bloody vaginal discharge, frequent urination, and signs of restlessness. Proestrus generally lasts nine days.\n2. Estrus follows, in which estrogen levels are high, mature eggs are released from both ovaries, and females become receptive both physically and mentally to copulation. Only during estrus will copulation result in pregnancy.\nDuring proestrus and estrus, females may have a clear, blood tinged, or bloody discharge. Dogs during these stages are often informally referred to as being in heat. The length of these cycles varies greatly among breeds and even between individuals of the same breed. Proestrus and estrus can last anywhere from 5 days to 21 days.\n3. Diestrus is the period following mating. Diestrus lasts approximately 56 to 60 days in a pregnant female, and 60 to 100 days in a non-pregnant female. During both of these periods, progesterone levels are high. Because the hormonal profile of a pregnant female and a female in diestrus are the same, sometimes a non-pregnant female will go through a period of pseudopregnancy.  At that time she may gain weight, have mammary gland development, produce milk, and exhibit nesting behaviours.\n4. Anestrus is the remaining period, the time of reproductive quiescence. The female has no attraction to mating. Anestrus generally lasts four to five months.", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canine_reproduction"}

When a male canine is interested in mounting a female, he will sniff the female's  vulva, which, for females in the estrus stage, has been secreted with Methyl p-hydroxybenzoate. If the female is unreceptive, she may sit, lie down, snap, retreat, or otherwise be uncooperative. If the female is receptive, she will stand still and hold her tail to the side, a stance referred to as \"flagging\". The male will often continue examining the female's rear, before mounting her from behind while attempting penetration with his penis.\nUnlike human sexual intercourse, where the male penis commonly becomes erect before entering the female, canine copulation involves the male first penetrating the female, after which swelling of the penis to erection occurs, which usually happens rapidly. At the time of penetration, the canine penis is not erect, and only able to penetrate the female because it includes a narrow bone called the \"baculum\", a feature of most placental mammals. When the male achieves penetration, he will usually hold the female tighter and thrust deeply. It is during this time that the male's penis expands and it is important that the bulbus glandis is sufficiently far inside for the female to be able to trap it.", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canine_reproduction"}

When the female's vagina subsequently contracts, the penis becomes locked inside the female. This is known as \"tying\" or \"knotting\". While characteristic of mating in most canids, the copulatory tie has been reported to be absent or very brief (less than one minute) in the African wild dog, possibly due to the abundance of large predators in its environment.\nWhen the penis is locked into the vagina by the bulbus glandis (when the stud is \"knotted\"), thrusting behavior stops and the male will usually lift a leg and swing it over the female's back while turning around. The two stand with their hind ends touching and the penis locked inside the vagina while ejaculation occurs, decreasing leakage of semen from the vagina. After some time, typically between 5 and 20 minutes (but sometimes longer), the bulbus glandis disengorges, allowing the mates to separate. Virgin dogs can become quite distressed at finding themselves unable to separate during their first copulation, and may try to pull away or run.

Since it is difficult to determine the exact date of ovulation, errors are often made in calculating gestation period. Canine sperm can live for 10 to 11 days   in the oviducts (fallopian tubes) so if a female is bred 10 days before the oocytes (eggs) can be fertilized, she will appear to have a gestation length of 70 days. If she is bred on the day the oocytes can be fertilized, her gestation length will appear to be 60 days long.\nDuring gestation, many physiological changes are similar to other mammals like humans. This results in similar shifts in nutrients in the blood of dogs, especially affecting glucose, fatty acids (like DHA) and amino acid (like BCAA) levels.\nA rule of thumb is that a mammal will produce half as many offspring as the number of teats on the mother. This rule is altered in domesticated animals since larger litters are often favoured for economic reasons and in dogs, particularly, the great range of sizes and shapes plays a role in how many healthy puppies a female can carry. A female dog usually has 10 teats, though this does not mean she can necessarily provide sufficient nutrition for 10 puppies in one litter.\nAn average litter consists of about five to six puppies, though this number may vary widely based on the breed of dog. Size of the breed is correlated with litter size. Miniature and small breeds average three to four puppies in each litter, with a maximum litter size of about 5–8. Large and giant breeds average 7 puppies per litter but can have a maximum litter size of about 15. In one study, the Rhodesian Ridgeback had the highest average litter size with 8.9 pups per litter while the Pomeranian and Toy Poodle had the lowest with 2.4 pups per litter.\nThe number of puppies also varies with the mother's age. In smaller breeds, both young and old age are associated with smaller litter size. In larger breeds, only old age is associated with smaller litter size. Use of artificial insemination is also associated with smaller litter size, with frozen semen having a stronger effect than fresh semen.\nThe largest litter size to date was set by a Neapolitan Mastiff in Manea, England, on November 29, 2004; the litter was 24 puppies.\nSome breeds have been developed to emphasize certain physical traits beyond the point at which they can safely bear litters on their own.\nA large scale study in Norway showed that across all breeds, about 4% of pups will be stillborn and a further 4% will die within the first week (early neonatal mortality). Between 8 days and 8 weeks, 1% will die. Litter size, breed size and age of the female is associated with increased risk. High risk breeds for stillborn includes the Dogue de Bordeaux (14.2%), St. Bernard (12.3%), Chow Chow (12.1%), Pembroke Welsh Corgis (11.7%) and Dalmatian (10.6%). The Basenji, Italian Greyhound, Australian Terrier, Irish Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier and the Bichon Havanais had few to no stillborns (0-0.6%). High risk breeds for early neonatal mortality includes the Rhodesian Ridgeback (11.6%), Dogue de Bordeaux (10.4% ), Dalmatians (8.8%) and Icelandic Sheepdog (8.7%) while the Basenji and Tibetan Terrier had no early neonatal mortality and the Border Terrier and Danish-Swedish Farmdog had <1% early neonatal mortality.\nCommon causes of early neonatal mortality are bacteria infection, fetal asphyxia and fading puppy syndrome. Other causes may include elective euthanasia because of congenital defects or failure to meet breed standards.\nOther multi-breed studies have put stillborn rates at 6.5–7% and early neonatal mortality at 11.5–19.8%.", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canine_reproduction"}

Inbreeding avoidance via mate selection is characteristic of the species and has important potential consequences for population persistence.  Inbreeding is rare within natal packs.  Computer-population simulations indicate that all populations continuing to avoid incestuous mating will become extinct within 100 years due to the unavailability of unrelated mates.  Thus the impact of reduced numbers of suitable unrelated mates will likely have a severe demographic impact on the future viability of small wild dog populations.\nRed wolves primarily live in packs composed of a socially monogamous breeding pair and offspring of different ages.  Using long-term data on red wolf individuals of known pedigree, it was found that inbreeding among first-degree relatives was rare.  A likely mechanism for avoidance of inbreeding is independent dispersal trajectories from the natal pack. Many of the young wolves spend time alone or in small non-breeding packs composed of unrelated individuals. The union of two unrelated individuals in a new home range is the predominant pattern of breeding pair formation.\nAmong Ethiopian wolves, most females disperse from their natal pack at about two years of age, and some become \"floaters\" that may successfully immigrate into existing packs.  Breeding pairs are most often unrelated to each other, suggesting that female-biased dispersal reduces inbreeding.\nGrey wolves and Arctic foxes also exhibit inbreeding avoidance.\nInbreeding is ordinarily avoided because it leads to a reduction in progeny fitness (inbreeding depression) due largely to the homozygous expression of deleterious recessive alleles.

Castration has also been known to reduce aggression in male dogs (in some cases), but spaying has been shown to occasionally increase aggression in female dogs.\nAnimal control agencies in the United States and the ASPCA advise that dogs not intended for further breeding should be spayed or neutered so that they do not have undesired puppies.  Spaying and castrating can decrease the risk of hormone-driven diseases such as mammary cancer, as well as undesired hormone-driven behaviors.  However, certain medical problems are more likely after neutering, such as urinary incontinence in females and prostate cancer in males.\nDogs shown in the conformation ring are not allowed to be either neutered or spayed. It disqualifies them from being shown as they must be intact and unaltered.\nFemale cats and dogs are seven times more likely to develop mammary tumors if they are not spayed before their first heat cycle.\nStudies have shown that spaying or neutering may be associated with increasing some serious health and behavioural consequences while reducing others. The American Veterinary Association (AVMA) position provides no single recommendation to spay or neuter nor for one single age for spay or neuter that is more or less optimal than another.

In a study by O'Farrell and Peachy, female dogs less than 11 months of age that had previously shown signs of aggression are more likely to have an increase in aggression after being spayed. These increases in aggression may be due to the sudden change in hormone concentrations that are the result of alteration. While spaying female dogs does not \"induce\" aggression, it can increase aggression and facilitate indiscriminate appetite in young altered females and can include them rapidly eating meals or eating food-associated items such as trash.\nAltered males:\nIn nearly 2/3 of the cases that involve inter-dog aggression, castration can help decrease aggression. Castration also decreases other male-typical behavioral traits such as mounting, roaming, and urine marking. But a few studies have shown that male behavioral issues of mounting, roaming and urine marking still exist in altered males.  Some people have reported after altering their male dogs that behavior such as roaming, mounting and urine marking has not changed the behavior.  Aggression may increase, as the decrease in testosterone may lead to emotional issues and become more likely to react aggressively when feeling under threat. Male puppies that are neutered between 7 and 10 weeks are three times less likely to display behavioral problems, compared to canines neutered at 6 months or older. Most dominantly aggressive dogs are male, which causes many people to neuter their male canine companions. Removing testosterone can decrease the intensity of a canine's reaction to stimulus.

It is one of only three known transmissible cancers in mammals; the others are devil facial tumor disease, a cancer which occurs in Tasmanian devils, and contagious reticulum cell sarcoma of the Syrian hamster.\nThe tumor cells are themselves the infectious agents, and the tumors that form are not genetically related to the host dog.

The concept that the tumor is naturally transmissible as an allograft came from three important observations. First, CTVTs can only be experimentally induced by transplanting living tumor cells, and not by killed cells or cell filtrates. Second, the tumor karyotype is aneuploid but has characteristic marker chromosomes in all tumors collected in different geographic regions. Third, a long interspersed nuclear element (LINE-1) insertion near the c-myc gene has been found in all tumors examined so far and can be used as a diagnostic marker to confirm that a tumor is a CTVT.\nCanine transmissible venereal tumors are most commonly seen in sexually active dogs in tropical, subtropical and temperate climates where there are large populations of stray dogs, but little is known about the details of transmission. The disease is spread when dogs mate, and can even be transmitted to other canine species, such as foxes and coyotes. Spontaneous regression of the tumor can occur, probably due to a response from the immune system. CTVT undergoes a predictable cycle: an initial growth phase of four to six months (P phase), a stable phase, and a regression phase (R phase), although not all CTVTs will regress. The tumor does not often metastasize (occurring in about less than 5 percent of cases), except in puppies and immunocompromised dogs. Metastasis occurs to regional lymph nodes, but can also be seen in the skin, brain, eye, liver, spleen, testicle, rectum and muscle. A biopsy is necessary for diagnosis.\nThe success of this single cell lineage, believed to be the longest continually propagated cell lineage in the world, can be attributed to the tumor's mode of transmission in a specific host system. Although direct contact is generally not a highly efficient mode of transfer, CTVTs take advantage of the popular sire effect of domestic dogs. A single male can produce dozens of litters over his lifetime, allowing the tumor to affect many more females than it could if a monogamous species were the host.

They have a critical role to play in the brain.  The Purkinje layer allows communication between the granular and molecular cortical layers in the cerebellum.

People with damage to the cerebellum can experience symptoms like unsteady gait, poor muscle control, and trouble speaking or swallowing.\nAbiotrophy means the loss of a vital nutritive factor.  The cause of cerebellar abiotrophy is not known, but it is thought to be due to an intrinsic metabolic defect.\nIn most cases, the Purkinje neurons begin to die off shortly after the animal is born and the condition is noticeable when the animal is less than six months old, though sometimes the onset of symptoms is gradual and the animal is much older before the owner or caretaker notices a problem.\nCerebellar abiotrophy cannot be prevented, other than by selective breeding to avoid the gene, and it cannot be cured.

Dogs may need lifetime assistance with tasks such as climbing stairs.\nIn horses, the symptoms may worsen from the time of onset for six to 12 months, but if not severe enough to mandate euthanasia, they stabilize over time. In some dog breeds, symptoms appear to progressively worsen, but research is not consistent on this point.  There also is some evidence that affected animals partially compensate for the condition by cognitively learning alternative methods for moving or to determine distance, and thus appear to improve because they become less accident-prone.", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebellar_abiotrophy"}
{"condition": "Cerebellar abiotrophy", "species": "dog", "section": "unlabelled", "paragraph_id": 3, "text": "Horses\nCerebellar abiotrophy is best known as a condition affecting Arabian horses.  It has also been observed in the Welsh pony and cob, the Australian pony, Curly horse, Miniature horse, the Gotland Pony, one Eriskay Pony, and possibly the Oldenburg.  Most foals appear normal at birth, with symptoms noticeable at an average age of four months, though there have been cases where the condition is first seen shortly after birth and other cases where symptoms are first recognized in horses over one year of age.\nBreeds DNA tested that reveal some carrier lines, but to date no affected animals, include the Welsh pony and the Trakehner. However, other breeds heavily influenced by Arabian breeding, such as the Thoroughbred and the American Saddlebred, do not appear to carry the mutation.\nIn horses, cerebellar abiotrophy is believed to be linked to an autosomal recessive gene.  This means it is not sex-linked, and the allele has to be carried and passed on by both parents in order for an affected animal to be born. Horses that only carry one copy of the gene may pass it on to their offspring, but themselves are perfectly healthy—without symptoms of the disease.  Because it is recessive, the allele for cerebellar abiotrophy may pass through multiple generations before it is expressed.\nCerebellar abiotrophy is sometimes misdiagnosed.  Though the symptoms are quite distinguishable from other neurological conditions, it has been confused with Wobbler's syndrome, equine protozoal myeloencephalitis, and injury-related problems such as a concussion.\nA DNA test which identifies markers associated with cerebellar abiotrophy became available in 2008.  The test was refined to identify the most likely mutations, and retesting of earlier samples based on an earlier indirect marker test developed by UCD, indicated a 97% accuracy rate for the old test relative to the newer version, with no false negatives. The causative mutation was identified on the gene TOE1 in 2011.  Research on cerebellar abiotrophy and the DNA test was led by the Veterinary Genetics Laboratory at the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine. Researchers working on this problem include Drs. Cecilia Penedo and Leah Brault.  Dr. Ann T.

It plays a major role in several forms of motor learning, including balance and posture.\nIn the past, the evidence for a role for the cerebellum in cognitive functions was rather weak.  However, investigations into the cognitive neuroscience of the cerebellum are rapidly advancing, extending far beyond the traditional view. For humans, current theories support that what the cerebellum does to sensorimotor and vestibular control, it also does to cognition, emotion, and autonomic function.  How it functions in cognition, emotion, or autonomic function in animals is still largely unknown. In 2012, a  study in mice provided direct evidence that subtle disruptions in cerebellar architecture can have pronounced effects on behaviors typically associated with \"autistic-like\" behavior.\nDevelopment of the cerebellum starts in a fetus in utero and, depending on the species, may continue for some period after birth.

It is suspected that the most common cause is animal parvoviruses.\nIn dogs, along with parvoviruses, it can be caused by canine herpes virus. The time frame to receive cerebellar hypoplasia is prenatal all the way up to four weeks old. Some non-infectious causes include injuries, heredity, and random events during development.\nIn cattle, cerebellar hypoplasia is the most frequent result of bovine virus diarrhea virus. This happens because the virus destroys brain cells in the immature cattle fetus. Loss of cells specifically in the cerebellum of the cattle fetus results in lesions that reduce the size of the cerebellum and cause cerebellar hypoplasia.  \nFeline panleukopenia (a.k.a. feline distemper or Feline Parvo) virus has long been known to cause cerebellar hypoplasia in neonatal kittens through in utero or perinatal infection.  In utero, the virus can pass from the dam to the developing fetus and may then disrupt the development of its cerebellum by hindering cell division. This can happen when the dam is actively infected with the virus or given a modified-live feline parvovirus vaccine when pregnant. Kittens are particularly vulnerable to cerebellar hypoplasia, in particular when the protective antibodies present in their mothers' milk are no longer present at four to twelve weeks of age. Unvaccinated adult cats are also prone to developing the condition.\nIn most cases, the cause is unknown. However, in dogs and cats, it is thought to be most likely related to in utero viral infections, toxins or genetic disorders.\nOther possible causes, if they occurred during the development period of the cerebellum and inhibit its growth, include:", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebellar_hypoplasia_(non-human)"}

Unless the causative condition is reversible, the only possible treatment is to help people live with their problems. Visualization of the fetal cerebellum by ultrasound scan at 18 to 20 weeks of pregnancy can be used to screen for fetal neural tube defects with a sensitivity rate of up to 99%.\nIn normal development, endogenous sonic hedgehog signaling stimulates rapid proliferation of cerebellar granule neuron progenitors (CGNPs) in the external granule layer (EGL). Cerebellar development occurs during late embryogenesis and the early postnatal period, with CGNP proliferation in the EGL peaking during early development (postnatal day 7 in the mouse). As CGNPs terminally differentiate into cerebellar granule cells (also called cerebellar granule neurons, CGNs), they migrate to the internal granule layer (IGL), forming the mature cerebellum (by post-natal day 20 in the mouse). Mutations that abnormally activate Sonic hedgehog signaling predispose to cancer of the cerebellum (medulloblastoma) in humans with Gorlin Syndrome and in genetically engineered mouse models.\nCongenital malformation or underdevelopment (hypoplasia) of the cerebellar vermis is a characteristic of both Dandy–Walker syndrome and Joubert syndrome. In very rare cases, the entire cerebellum may be absent. The inherited neurological disorders Machado–Joseph disease, ataxia telangiectasia, and Friedreich's ataxia cause progressive neurodegeneration linked to cerebellar loss. Congenital brain malformations outside the cerebellum can, in turn, cause herniation of cerebellar tissue, as seen in some forms of Arnold–Chiari malformation.\nOther conditions that are closely linked to cerebellar degeneration include the idiopathic progressive neurological disorders multiple system atrophy and Ramsay Hunt syndrome type I, and the autoimmune disorder paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration, in which tumors elsewhere in the body elicit an autoimmune response that causes neuronal loss in the cerebellum. Cerebellar atrophy can result from an acute deficiency of vitamin B1 (thiamine) as seen in beriberi and in Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome, or vitamin E deficiency.\nCerebellar atrophy has been observed in many other neurological disorders including Huntington's disease, multiple sclerosis, essential tremor, progressive myoclonus epilepsy, and Niemann–Pick disease.

Cherry eye is most often seen in young dogs under the age of two. Common misnomers include adenitis, hyperplasia, adenoma of the gland of the third eyelid; however, cherry eye is not caused by hyperplasia, neoplasia, or primary inflammation. In many species, the third eyelid plays an essential role in vision by supplying oxygen and nutrients to the eye via tear production. Normally, the gland can turn inside-out without detachment. Cherry eye results from a defect in the retinaculum which is responsible for anchoring the gland to the periorbita. This defect causes the gland to prolapse and protrude from the eye as a red fleshy mass.

Some breeds are considered to be more susceptible to its development than others, including the Bulldog, Boston Terrier, Bull Terrier, Lhasa Apso, Cocker Spaniel, St. Bernard, Shar-pei, Shih Tzu and Poodle  The NM contains many glands which merge and appear as a single gland. Typically, glands secrete tears for lubrication of the cornea. Lack of anchoring allows the gland to flip up, causing the gland to prolapse. Symptoms include a visible fleshy mass, abnormal tear production, and a discharge or drainage from the eye. Cherry eye is typically diagnosed by examination of the conjunctiva and nictitating membrane. The most obvious symptom of cherry eye is a round fleshy mass in the medial canthus of the eye, similar in appearance to the fruit it is named for. This mass may be unilateral or ‘’bilateral’’.

The system uses conditioned reinforcers, which a trainer can deliver more quickly and more precisely than primary reinforcers such as food. The term \"clicker\" comes from a small metal cricket noisemaker adapted from a child's toy that the trainer uses to precisely mark the desired behavior. When training a new behavior, the clicker helps the animal to quickly identify the precise behavior that results in the treat. The technique is popular with dog trainers, but can be used for all kinds of domestic and wild animals.\nSometimes, instead of a click to mark the desired behavior, other distinctive sounds are made (such as a \"whistle, a click of the tongue, a snap of the fingers, or even a word\") or visual or other sensory cues (such as a flashlight, hand sign, or vibrating collar), especially helpful for deaf animals.", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clicker_training"}

Skinner first identified and described the principles of operant conditioning that are used in clicker training. Two students of Skinner's, Marian Kruse and Keller Breland, worked with him researching pigeon behavior and training projects during World War II, when pigeons were taught to \"bowl\" (push a ball with their beaks). They believed that traditional animal training was being needlessly hindered because methods of praise and reward then in use did not inform the animal of success with enough promptness and precision to create the required cognitive connections for speedy learning. They saw the potential for using the operation conditioning method in commercial animal training. The two later married and in 1947 created Animal Behavior Enterprises (ABE), \"the first commercial animal training business to intentionally and systematically incorporate the principles of behavior analysis and operant conditioning into animal training.\"\nThe Brelands coined the term \"bridging stimulus\" in the 1940s to refer to the function of a secondary reinforcer such as a whistle or click. ABE continued operations until 1990, with the assistance of Bob Bailey after Keller Breland died in 1965. They report having trained over 15,000 animals and over 150 species during their time in operation. Their positive methods contrasted with traditional training using aversives such as choke chains, prong collars, leash snapping, ear pinching, “alpha-rolling,” the shock collar, elephant goad, cattle prods, and elephant crushing.\nAlthough the Brelands tried to promote clicker training for dogs in the 1940s and 1950s, and the method had been used successfully in zoos and marine mammal training, the method failed to catch on for dogs until the late 1980s and early 1990s.  In 1992, animal trainers Karen Pryor and Gary Wilkes started giving clicker training seminars to dog owners.  In 1998, Alexandra Kurland published \"Clicker Training For Your Horse,\" which rejected horse training that uses aversives such as horsebreaking and the use of the spur, bit (horse), crop (implement), and longeing with a horsewhip. By the 1990s, many zoos used clicker training for animal husbandry because with this method, they did not have to use force or medication. They could be moved to different pens or given veterinary treatments with much less stress on the animals. In the 21st century, training books began to appear for other companion animals, such as cats, birds, and rabbits (See \"Further Reading\").", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clicker_training"}

The clicker is used as a \"bridge\" between the marking of the behaviour and the rewarding with a primary reinforcer such as a treat or a toy. The behaviour can be elicited by \"luring\", where a hand gesture or a treat is used to coax the dog to sit, for example; or by \"shaping\", where increasingly closer approximations to the desired behaviour are reinforced; and by \"capturing\", where the dog's spontaneous offering of the behaviour is rewarded.

Mild asymptomatic cases often do not require any treatment. Those with severe symptoms may benefit from antifungal therapy, which requires 3–6 months or more of treatment, depending on the response to the treatment. There is a lack of prospective studies that examine optimal antifungal therapy for coccidioidomycosis.\nOn the whole, oral fluconazole and intravenous amphotericin B are used in progressive or disseminated disease or immunocompromised individuals. Amphotericin B was originally the only available treatment, but alternatives, including itraconazole and ketoconazole, became available for milder disease. Fluconazole is the preferred medication for coccidioidal meningitis, due to its penetration into CSF. Intrathecal or intraventricular amphotericin B therapy is used if infection persists after fluconazole treatment. Itraconazole is used for cases of coccidioidomycosis infections that involve a person's bones and joints. The antifungal medications posaconazole and voriconazole have also been used to treat coccidioidomycosis.  Because the symptoms of coccidioidomycosis are similar to those of common flu, pneumonia, and other respiratory diseases, public health professionals need to be aware of the rise of coccidioidomycosis and the specifics of diagnosis.

Species of Isospora are host-specific, infecting only one species. Species that infect dogs include I. canis, I. ohioensis, I. burrowsi, and I. neorivolta. Species that infect cats include I. felis and I. rivolta. The most common symptom is diarrhea. Sulfonamides are the most common treatment.\nGenus Eimeria affects birds such as poultry and mammals such as cattle and rabbits. Species include E. tenella, E. brunetti, E. necatrix, and E. acervulina. Sulfonamides are effective.\nGenus Cryptosporidium contains two species known to cause cryptosporidiosis, C. parvum and C. muris. Cattle are most commonly affected, and their feces may be a source of infection for other mammals, including humans. Recent genetic analyses of Cryptosporidium in humans have identified C. hominis as a human-specific pathogen. Infection occurs most commonly in immunocompromised individuals, such as dogs with canine distemper, cats with feline leukemia, and humans with AIDS.\nGenus Hammondia is transmitted by ingestion of cysts found in the tissue of grazing animals and rodents. Dogs and cats are the definitive hosts, with H. heydorni infecting dogs and the H. hammondi and H. pardalis infecting cats. Symptoms do not usually occur.\nGenus Besnoitia infects cats that ingest cysts in the tissue of rodents and opossums, but usually do not cause disease.\nGenus Sarcocystis infects carnivores that ingest cysts from various intermediate hosts. Sarcocystis may cause disease in dogs and cats.\nGenus Toxoplasma has one important species, T. gondii. Cats are the definitive host, but all mammals and some fish, reptiles, and amphibians can be intermediate hosts. Only cat feces will hold infective oocysts, but infection through ingestion of cysts can occur with the tissue of any intermediate host. Toxoplasmosis occurs in humans usually as low-grade fever or muscle pain for a few days. A normal immune system will suppress the infection but the tissue cysts will persist in that animal or human for years or for life. In immunocompromised individuals, dormant cysts can be reactivated and cause lesions in the brain, heart, lungs, eyes, and other tissues. A fetus may be at risk if a pregnant woman without immunity becomes infected. Symptoms in cats include fever, weight loss, diarrhea, vomiting, uveitis, and central nervous system signs. Disease in dogs includes paralysis, tremors, and seizures. Dogs and cats are usually treated with clindamycin.\nGenus Neospora has one important species, N. caninum, which affects dogs in a manner similar to toxoplasmosis. Neosporosis is difficult to treat.\nGenus Hepatozoon contains one species that causes hepatozoonosis in dogs and cats, H. canis. Animals become infected by ingesting an infected brown dog tick (Rhipicephalus sanguineus). Symptoms include fever, weight loss, and pain in the spine and limbs.\nThe most common medications used to treat coccidian infections are in the sulfonamide antibiotic family.\nDepending on the pathogen and the condition of the animal, untreated coccidiosis may clear of its own accord, or become severe and damaging, and sometimes cause death.", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coccidiosis"}

Also, mild cases of choroidal hypoplasia may become pigmented and therefore undiagnosable by the age of three to seven months.  If puppies are not checked for CEA before this happens, they may be mistaken for normal and bred as such.  Checking for CEA by seven weeks of age can eliminate this possibility.  Diagnosis is also difficult in dogs with coats of dilute color because lack of pigment in the choroid of these animals can be confused with choroidal hypoplasia.  Also, because of the lack of choroidal pigment, mild choroidal hypoplasia is difficult to see, and therefore cases of CEA may be missed.\nUntil recently, the only way to know if a dog was a carrier was for it to produce an affected puppy. However, a genetic test for CEA became available at the beginning of 2005, developed by the Baker Institute for Animal Health, Cornell University, and administered through OptiGen.

Astrogliosis (an increase in the number of astrocytes) is also noted.  The lesions are most commonly found in the lateral pyramidal tract of the lumbar spinal cord, the fasciculi gracili of the dorsal column of the cervical spinal cord, and the cerebellar vermian white matter.  Symptoms start at the age of 8 to 10 weeks, and include frequent falling and walking on the hock.  The prognosis is poor.  The disease is suspected to have a recessive mode of inheritance.\nBotulism is very rare in dogs and usually follows feeding on carrion.  Symptoms include weakness, difficulty eating, acute facial nerve paralysis, and megaesophagus.  Compared to other species, dogs and cats are relatively resistant to botulism.\nDancing Doberman disease primarily affects the gastrocnemius muscle in Dobermans.  It usually starts between the ages of 6 and 7 months.  One rear leg will flex while standing.  Over the next few months, it will begin to affect the other rear leg.  Eventually, the dog is alternatively flexing and extending each rear leg in a dancing motion.  Dancing Doberman disease progresses over a few years to rear leg weakness and muscle atrophy.  No treatment is known, but most dogs retain the ability to walk and it is painless.\nDiabetes neuropathy is more common in cats than dogs.  It is caused in part by prolonged hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) and results in dysfunction of one or both tibial nerves and a plantigrade stance (down on the hocks).  It may resolve with treatment of the diabetes.  The pathology of this condition in cats has been shown to be very similar to diabetic neuropathy in humans.\nDistal symmetric polyneuropathy symptoms include atrophy of the distal leg muscles and the muscles of the head, and rear limb weakness.  No treatment is known and the prognosis is poor.  This is most commonly seen in Chesapeake Bay Retrievers, St. Bernards, Great Danes, Newfoundlands, Collies, and Labrador Retrievers.\nDysautonomia is primarily seen in cats.  Symptoms include vomiting, depression, anorexia, weight loss, dilated pupils, third eyelid protrusion, sneezing, slow heart rate, and megaesophagus.  The prognosis is poor and supportive treatment is necessary.  Recovery in cats may take up to one year.\nGiant axonal neuropathy is a rare disease in the German Shepherd dog.  It usually becomes evident between the ages of 14 and 16 months.  Symptoms include rear limb weakness, decreased reflexes, muscle atrophy, megaesophagus, and loss of bark.  No treatment is known and it has a poor prognosis.\nHyperchylomicronemia or hyperlipoproteinemia is a type of inherited hyperlipidemia in cats.  Polyneuropathy is caused by stretching or compression of nerves near bone by xanthomas, which are lipid deposits.  It can cause Horner's syndrome, facial nerve paralysis, and femoral nerve, tibial nerve, radial nerve, trigeminal nerve, or recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis.\nHypertrophic neuropathy  is also known as canine inherited demyelinative neuropathy (CIDN) and is inherited in the Tibetan Mastiff. Symptoms usually start between the ages of 7 and 10 weeks, and include weakness, decreased reflexes, and loss of bark.  Sensory function remains, but a poor gait or an inability to walk may present.  With no treatment available, the prognosis is guarded.  The trait is inherited as an autosomal recessive.\nHypoglycemia-induced  polyneuropathy is especially seen in conjunction with insulinoma.\nMyasthenia gravis\nPolyradiculoneuritis is inflammation of the nerve roots.  The most common type is Coonhound paralysis.  This is similar to Guillain–Barré syndrome in humans.  Coonhound paralysis seems to be secondary to a raccoon bite, probably due to some factor in the saliva.  However, it can also occur without any interaction with a raccoon. It can happen in any breed of dog.  When associated with a raccoon bite, the symptoms start 7 to 11 days after the bite, and include rear leg weakness progressing rapidly to paresis, and decreased reflexes.  When not associated with a raccoon bite, the same symptoms occur, with the paresis taking about 3–4 days to reach its maximum effect. Severe cases have a loss of bark, trouble breathing, and an inability to lift the head.  Typically, the duration of the paralysis is 2 to 3 months, but can last up to 6 months. Treatment is proper nursing care, and the prognosis is good in mild cases. In bad cases, the dog does not completely recover the initial muscular capability but still is able to live for years.  In very bad cases, breathing can be impaired, and unless the dog is placed on a ventilator, suffocation will occur. Polyradiculoneuritis has also been seen 1-2o weeks after vaccination in dogs and cats.  It can also be caused by toxoplasmosis.\nRottweiler distal sensorimotor polyneuropathy is characterized by distal muscle denervation, but the cause is unknown.  It affects young adult Rottweilers.  The symptoms include weakness of all four legs and decreased reflexes.  The disease is gradually progressive.  Treatment is possible with corticosteroids, but the prognosis is poor.\nSensory neuropathies are inherited conditions in dogs and cause an inability to feel pain and a loss of proprioception.  Self-mutilation is often seen.  No treatment has been found, and the prognosis is poor in severe cases.  Several breeds are affected:\nBoxer symptoms usually occur around two months of age as a slowly progressive disease.\nDachshund (longhaired) disease usually occurs between 8 and 12 weeks of age, and causes urinary incontinence, loss of pain sensation all over the body, and penis mutilation.  It is probably inherited as an autosomal recessive trait.\nEnglish Pointer illness usually occurs between the ages of 3 and 8 months and most commonly involves licking and biting at the paws.  No treatment is known and a poor prognosis is given.  It is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait.\nSpinal muscular atrophy occurs in cats and dogs, and is caused by the death of nerve cells in the spinal cord.  This progressive disease has no known treatment and a poor prognosis.  Affected dog breeds include the Swedish Lapland Dog, Brittany Spaniel, English Pointer, German Shepherd dog, Rottweiler, and Cairn Terrier. Maine Coons are one of the affected cat breeds.\nTick paralysis is an acute, ascending motor paralysis that occurs in dogs and cats.   The cause is a neurotoxin in the saliva of certain species of adult ticks.  Dermacentor species predominate as a cause in North America, while Ixodes species mainly cause the disease in Australia.  The onset of symptoms is 5 to 9 days after tick attachment, and include incoordination progressing to paralysis, changed voice, and difficulty eating.  Death can occur secondary to paralysis of the respiratory muscles, but in North America, a good prognosis results once the ticks are removed.  Recovery is usually in 1 to 3 days.  In Australia, however, it is a more severe disease with cranial nerve effects, and death can occur in 1 to 2 days.\nToxic neuropathies are most commonly caused by vincristine, thallium, and lead. In cats, the symptoms include paresis, hyporeflexia, and muscle tremors.", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyneuropathy_in_dogs_and_cats"}

It refracts light and protects the contents of the eye. The cornea is about one-half to one millimeter thick in the dog and cat. The trigeminal nerve supplies the cornea via the long ciliary nerves. There are pain receptors in the outer layers and pressure receptors deeper.\nTransparency is achieved through a lack of blood vessels, pigmentation, and keratin, and through the organization of the collagen fibers. The collagen fibers cross the full diameter of the cornea in a strictly parallel fashion and allow 99 percent of the light to pass through without scattering.\nThere are four important layers in the dog and cat cornea. The outer layer is the epithelium, which is 25 to 40 micrometers and five to seven cell layers thick. The epithelium holds the tear film in place and also prevents water from invading the cornea and disrupting the collagen fibers. This prevents corneal edema, which gives it a cloudy appearance. It is also a barrier to infectious agents. The epithelium sticks to the basement membrane, which also separates the epithelium from the stroma. The corneal stroma comprises 90 percent of the thickness of the cornea. It contains the collagen fibers organized into lamellae. The lamellae are in sheets which separate easily. Posterior to the stroma is Descemet's membrane, which is a basement membrane for the corneal endothelium.

If this test is abnormal, the cortisol may be measured late at night. If the cortisol remains high, a blood test for ACTH may be done.\nMost cases can be treated and cured. If brought on by medications, these can often be slowly decreased if still required or slowly stopped. If caused by a tumor, it may be treated by a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiation. If the pituitary was affected, other medications may be required to replace its lost function. With treatment, life expectancy is usually normal. Some, in whom surgery is unable to remove the entire tumor, have an increased risk of death.\nAbout two to three cases per million persons are caused overtly by a tumor. It most commonly affects people who are 20 to 50 years of age. Women are affected three times more often than men. A mild degree of overproduction of cortisol without obvious symptoms, however, is more common. Cushing's syndrome was first described by American neurosurgeon Harvey Cushing in 1932. Cushing's syndrome may also occur in other animals including cats, dogs, and horses.", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cushing%27s_syndrome"}

Common signs include the growth of fat pads along the collarbone, on the back of the neck (\"buffalo hump\" or lipodystrophy), and on the face (\"moon face\"). Other symptoms include excess sweating, dilation of capillaries, thinning of the skin (which causes easy bruising and dryness, particularly the hands) and mucous membranes, purple or red striae (the weight gain in Cushing's syndrome stretches the skin, which is thin and weakened, causing it to hemorrhage) on the trunk, buttocks, arms, legs, or breasts, proximal muscle weakness (hips, shoulders), and hirsutism (facial male-pattern hair growth), baldness and/or extremely dry and brittle hair. In rare cases, Cushing's can cause hypocalcemia. The excess cortisol may also affect other endocrine systems and cause, for example, insomnia, inhibited aromatase, reduced libido, impotence in men, and amenorrhoea, oligomenorrhea and infertility in women due to elevations in androgens. Studies have also shown that the resultant amenorrhea is due to hypercortisolism, which feeds back onto the hypothalamus resulting in decreased levels of GnRH release.\nMany of the features of Cushing's are those seen in metabolic syndrome, including insulin resistance, hypertension, obesity, and elevated blood levels of triglycerides.\nCognitive conditions, including memory and attention dysfunctions, as well as depression, are commonly associated with elevated cortisol, and may be early indicators of exogenous or endogenous Cushing's. Depression and anxiety disorders are also common.\nOther striking and distressing skin changes that may appear in Cushing's syndrome include facial acne, susceptibility to superficial fungus (dermatophyte and malassezia) infections, and the characteristic purplish, atrophic striae on the abdomen.\nOther signs include increased urination (and accompanying increased thirst), persistent high blood pressure (due to cortisol's enhancement of epinephrine's vasoconstrictive effect) and insulin resistance (especially common with ACTH production outside the pituitary), leading to high blood sugar and insulin resistance which can lead to diabetes mellitus.  Insulin resistance is accompanied by skin changes such as acanthosis nigricans in the axilla and around the neck, as well as skin tags in the axilla. Untreated Cushing's syndrome can lead to heart disease and increased mortality. Cortisol can also exhibit mineralocorticoid activity in high concentrations, worsening the hypertension and leading to hypokalemia (common in ectopic ACTH secretion) and hypernatremia (increased Na+ ions concentration in plasma). Furthermore, excessive cortisol may lead to gastrointestinal disturbances, opportunistic infections, and impaired wound healing related to cortisol's suppression of the immune and inflammatory responses. Osteoporosis is also an issue in Cushing's syndrome since osteoblast activity is inhibited. Additionally, Cushing's syndrome may cause sore and aching joints, particularly in the hip, shoulders, and lower back.\nBrain changes such as cerebral atrophy may occur. This atrophy is associated with areas of high glucocorticoid receptor concentrations such as the hippocampus and correlates highly with psychopathological personality changes.\nAdditional symptoms may include:", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cushing%27s_syndrome"}

Rachman in 1977 maintains that there are three conditions by which fear is developed. These include direct personal experience, observational experience, and informational or instructional experience. For example, direct personal experience consists of having a personal negative encounter with a dog such as being bitten. In contrast, seeing a friend attacked by a dog and thus developing a fear of dogs would be observational experience. Whereas both of these types of experiences involves a live dog, informational or instructional experience simply includes being told directly or indirectly (i.e., information read in a book, film, parental cues such as avoidance or dislike, etc.) that dogs are to be feared.\nA study was conducted at the State University of New York to distinguish the significance of these three conditions upon the development of cynophobia. Thirty-seven women ages 18 to 21 were first screened into two groups: fearful of dogs and non-fearful of dogs. Next, each woman was given a questionnaire which asked if she had ever had a frightening or painful confrontation with a dog, what her expectation was upon encountering a dog (pain, fear, etc.), and subjectively, what was the probability of that expectation actually occurring. The results indicated that, while non-fearful subjects had a different expectation of what would happen when encountering a dog, painful experiences with dogs were common among both groups; therefore, the study concluded that other factors must affect whether or not these painful experiences will develop into dog phobia.\nAlthough Rachman's theory is the accepted model of fear acquisition, cases of cynophobia have been cited in which none of these three causes apply to the patient. In a speech given at the 25th Annual Meeting of the Society for Psychophysiological Research, Arne Öhman proposed that animal fears in particular are likely to be an evolutionary remnant of the necessity \"to escape and to avoid becoming the prey of predators\". Furthermore, in his book Overcoming Animal/Insect Phobias, Martin Antony suggests that in the absence of Rachman's three causes, providing that the patient's memory is sound, biological factors may be a fourth cause of fear acquisition—meaning that the fear is inherited or is a throwback to an earlier genetic defense mechanism. In any case, these causes may in actuality be a generalization of a complicated blend of both learning and genetics.", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynophobia"}

Astrogliosis (an increase in the number of astrocytes) is also noted.  The lesions are most commonly found in the lateral pyramidal tract of the lumbar spinal cord, the fasciculi gracili of the dorsal column of the cervical spinal cord, and the cerebellar vermian white matter.  Symptoms start at the age of 8 to 10 weeks, and include frequent falling and walking on the hock.  The prognosis is poor.  The disease is suspected to have a recessive mode of inheritance.\nBotulism is very rare in dogs and usually follows feeding on carrion.  Symptoms include weakness, difficulty eating, acute facial nerve paralysis, and megaesophagus.  Compared to other species, dogs and cats are relatively resistant to botulism.\nDancing Doberman disease primarily affects the gastrocnemius muscle in Dobermans.  It usually starts between the ages of 6 and 7 months.  One rear leg will flex while standing.  Over the next few months, it will begin to affect the other rear leg.  Eventually, the dog is alternatively flexing and extending each rear leg in a dancing motion.  Dancing Doberman disease progresses over a few years to rear leg weakness and muscle atrophy.  No treatment is known, but most dogs retain the ability to walk and it is painless.\nDiabetes neuropathy is more common in cats than dogs.  It is caused in part by prolonged hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) and results in dysfunction of one or both tibial nerves and a plantigrade stance (down on the hocks).  It may resolve with treatment of the diabetes.  The pathology of this condition in cats has been shown to be very similar to diabetic neuropathy in humans.\nDistal symmetric polyneuropathy symptoms include atrophy of the distal leg muscles and the muscles of the head, and rear limb weakness.  No treatment is known and the prognosis is poor.  This is most commonly seen in Chesapeake Bay Retrievers, St. Bernards, Great Danes, Newfoundlands, Collies, and Labrador Retrievers.\nDysautonomia is primarily seen in cats.  Symptoms include vomiting, depression, anorexia, weight loss, dilated pupils, third eyelid protrusion, sneezing, slow heart rate, and megaesophagus.  The prognosis is poor and supportive treatment is necessary.  Recovery in cats may take up to one year.\nGiant axonal neuropathy is a rare disease in the German Shepherd dog.  It usually becomes evident between the ages of 14 and 16 months.  Symptoms include rear limb weakness, decreased reflexes, muscle atrophy, megaesophagus, and loss of bark.  No treatment is known and it has a poor prognosis.\nHyperchylomicronemia or hyperlipoproteinemia is a type of inherited hyperlipidemia in cats.  Polyneuropathy is caused by stretching or compression of nerves near bone by xanthomas, which are lipid deposits.  It can cause Horner's syndrome, facial nerve paralysis, and femoral nerve, tibial nerve, radial nerve, trigeminal nerve, or recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis.\nHypertrophic neuropathy  is also known as canine inherited demyelinative neuropathy (CIDN) and is inherited in the Tibetan Mastiff. Symptoms usually start between the ages of 7 and 10 weeks, and include weakness, decreased reflexes, and loss of bark.  Sensory function remains, but a poor gait or an inability to walk may present.  With no treatment available, the prognosis is guarded.  The trait is inherited as an autosomal recessive.\nHypoglycemia-induced  polyneuropathy is especially seen in conjunction with insulinoma.\nMyasthenia gravis\nPolyradiculoneuritis is inflammation of the nerve roots.  The most common type is Coonhound paralysis.  This is similar to Guillain–Barré syndrome in humans.  Coonhound paralysis seems to be secondary to a raccoon bite, probably due to some factor in the saliva.  However, it can also occur without any interaction with a raccoon. It can happen in any breed of dog.  When associated with a raccoon bite, the symptoms start 7 to 11 days after the bite, and include rear leg weakness progressing rapidly to paresis, and decreased reflexes.  When not associated with a raccoon bite, the same symptoms occur, with the paresis taking about 3–4 days to reach its maximum effect. Severe cases have a loss of bark, trouble breathing, and an inability to lift the head.  Typically, the duration of the paralysis is 2 to 3 months, but can last up to 6 months. Treatment is proper nursing care, and the prognosis is good in mild cases. In bad cases, the dog does not completely recover the initial muscular capability but still is able to live for years.  In very bad cases, breathing can be impaired, and unless the dog is placed on a ventilator, suffocation will occur. Polyradiculoneuritis has also been seen 1-2o weeks after vaccination in dogs and cats.  It can also be caused by toxoplasmosis.\nRottweiler distal sensorimotor polyneuropathy is characterized by distal muscle denervation, but the cause is unknown.  It affects young adult Rottweilers.  The symptoms include weakness of all four legs and decreased reflexes.  The disease is gradually progressive.  Treatment is possible with corticosteroids, but the prognosis is poor.\nSensory neuropathies are inherited conditions in dogs and cause an inability to feel pain and a loss of proprioception.  Self-mutilation is often seen.  No treatment has been found, and the prognosis is poor in severe cases.  Several breeds are affected:\nBoxer symptoms usually occur around two months of age as a slowly progressive disease.\nDachshund (longhaired) disease usually occurs between 8 and 12 weeks of age, and causes urinary incontinence, loss of pain sensation all over the body, and penis mutilation.  It is probably inherited as an autosomal recessive trait.\nEnglish Pointer illness usually occurs between the ages of 3 and 8 months and most commonly involves licking and biting at the paws.  No treatment is known and a poor prognosis is given.  It is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait.\nSpinal muscular atrophy occurs in cats and dogs, and is caused by the death of nerve cells in the spinal cord.  This progressive disease has no known treatment and a poor prognosis.  Affected dog breeds include the Swedish Lapland Dog, Brittany Spaniel, English Pointer, German Shepherd dog, Rottweiler, and Cairn Terrier. Maine Coons are one of the affected cat breeds.\nTick paralysis is an acute, ascending motor paralysis that occurs in dogs and cats.   The cause is a neurotoxin in the saliva of certain species of adult ticks.  Dermacentor species predominate as a cause in North America, while Ixodes species mainly cause the disease in Australia.  The onset of symptoms is 5 to 9 days after tick attachment, and include incoordination progressing to paralysis, changed voice, and difficulty eating.  Death can occur secondary to paralysis of the respiratory muscles, but in North America, a good prognosis results once the ticks are removed.  Recovery is usually in 1 to 3 days.  In Australia, however, it is a more severe disease with cranial nerve effects, and death can occur in 1 to 2 days.\nToxic neuropathies are most commonly caused by vincristine, thallium, and lead. In cats, the symptoms include paresis, hyporeflexia, and muscle tremors.", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyneuropathy_in_dogs_and_cats"}

It is also known as pilonidal sinus.  However, unlike pilonidal sinus in humans, the dermoid sinus in dogs is a neural tube defect. Dermoid sinus is sometimes also confused with dermoid cyst (a teratoma).\nA dermoid sinus is rare in dogs and cats.  It can appear as single or multiple lumps on the dorsal midline.  The sinus is caused in the embryonic stage of development.  In normal development, the neural tube from which the spine develops separates from the skin.  In the case of a dermoid sinus, this separation has not fully taken place.  The result is that in some cases, the dermoid sinus remains connected to the animal's spinal cord; in other cases, the sinus terminates in a \"blind sac\" that is less dangerous to remove.  Histologically, the dermoid sinus contains hair follicles, sebaceous glands, and sweat glands.  If the sinus becomes infected, it can result in meningitis and myelitis, symptoms of which are spinal pain, rigidity, and fever.  In serious cases, the condition can be life-threatening.\nThe dermoid sinus gene is believed by some to be recessive, meaning that the animal must receive one defective gene from each parent in order to develop the condition.  Where one parent carries the gene and the other does not, the offspring remain carriers and can continue to pass the defective gene on to their offspring in turn.  Others believe that the dermoid sinus condition is more appropriately characterized as polygenic, involving multiple genes.  In any case, because of the genetic nature of this potentially dangerous condition, most breeders and veterinarians advise against breeding animals that have a dermoid sinus, or have a parent that is known to carry the gene.\nSurgical excision is the only remedy for this condition, with veterinary surgeons removing abnormal tissue and closing any connections to the spine, In some cases, regrowth of the sinus occurs.  A variety of tests, such as a myelogram or a fistulogram may be undertaken to determine how deep the sinus goes.  Other, more basic tests, such as a complete blood count, biochemical profile, and urinalysis can be performed to determine if infection or other problems exist.  Computed tomography scans and magnetic resonance imaging may be undertaken to determine if neurological signs exist as a result of the sinus.\nBreeds known to be affected include Rhodesian Ridgeback, Phu Quoc Ridgeback, and Thai Ridgeback, in which it is hereditary, Kerry Blue Terriers, Shih Tzus and Boxers.", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermoid_sinus"}

It works at the level of the renal collecting duct by binding to V2 receptors, which signal for the translocation of aquaporin channels via cytosolic vesicles to the apical membrane of the collecting duct. The presence of these aquaporin channels in the distal nephron causes increasing water reabsorption from the urine, which becomes passively re-distributed from the nephron to systemic circulation by way of basolateral membrane channels. Desmopressin also stimulates release of von Willebrand factor from endothelial cells by acting on the V2 receptor. It also increases endogenous levels of factor VIII, making it useful in the treatment of hemophilia A.\nDesmopressin is degraded more slowly than recombinant vasopressin, and requires less frequent administration. In addition, it has little effect on blood pressure, while vasopressin may cause arterial hypertension. Vasopressin stimulates the release of ACTH, which indirectly increases responsiveness of alpha-1 receptor in blood vessel smooth muscle, increasing vessel tone and blood pressure. Several studies have shown that Desmopressin does not stimulate ACTH release (except in Cushing's Disease), and therefore does not directly raise blood pressure, however, one study showed that it stimulates ACTH release in over 50% of healthy subjects. Additionally, desmopressin is able to enhance ACTH and cortisol release in normal subjects following oCRH administration, but not in patients with anorexia nervosa.", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desmopressin"}

Canine primary diabetes mirrors type 1 human diabetes in the inability to produce insulin and the need for exogenous replacement of it, but the target of canine diabetes autoantibodies has yet to be identified. Breed and treatment studies have been able to provide some evidence of a genetic connection. Studies have furnished evidence that canine diabetes has a seasonal connection not unlike its human Type 1 diabetes counterpart, and a \"lifestyle\" factor, with pancreatitis being a clear cause. This evidence suggests that the disease in dogs has some environmental and dietary factors involved. Canine obesity causes the corresponding diabetes in dogs also known as canine diabetes (Hoeing 2014).\nSecondary diabetes may be caused by use of steroid medications, the hormones of estrus, acromegaly, (spaying can resolve the diabetes), pregnancy, or other medical conditions such as Cushing's disease.

Without insulin, glucose is unable to enter the cells where it will be used for this and other anabolic (\"building up\") purposes, such as the synthesis of glycogen, proteins, and fatty acids. Insulin is also an active preventor of the breakdown or catabolism of glycogen and fat. The absence of sufficient insulin causes this breaking-down process to be accelerated; it is the mechanism behind metabolizing fat instead of glucose and the appearance of ketones.\nSince the glucose that normally enters the cells is unable to do so without insulin, it begins to build up in the blood where it can be seen as hyperglycemia or high blood glucose levels. The tubules of the kidneys are normally able to re-absorb glucose, but they are unable to handle and process the amount of glucose they are being presented with. At this point, which is called the renal threshold, the excess glucose spills into the urine (glycosuria), where it can be seen in urine glucose testing. It is the polyuria, or over-frequent urination, which causes polydipsia, or excessive water consumption, through an osmotic process. Even though there is an overabundance of glucose, the lack of insulin does not allow it to enter the cells. As a result, they are not able to receive nourishment from their normal glucose source.

Since dogs are insulin dependent, oral diabetes drugs, which require a functional endocrine pancreas with beta cells capable of producing insulin, are ineffective. Diabetic dogs require insulin therapy, which must be continued for life.\nThe goal of treatment is to regulate blood glucose using insulin and some probable diet and daily routine changes. The process may take a few weeks or many months and is similar as in type 1 diabetic humans. The aim is to keep the blood glucose values in an acceptable range. The commonly recommended dosing method is by \"starting low and going slow\" as indicated for people with diabetes.\nDuring the initial process of regulation and periodically thereafter, the effectiveness of the insulin dose at controlling blood glucose is evaluated. This is done by a series of blood glucose tests called a curve.  Blood samples are taken and tested at intervals of one to two hours over a 12- or 24-hour period. The results are generally transferred into graph form for easier interpretation. They are compared against the feeding and insulin injection times for judgment. The curve provides information regarding the action of the insulin in the animal. It is used to determine insulin dose adjustments, determine lowest and highest blood glucose levels, discover insulin duration and, in the case of continued hyperglycemia, whether the cause is insufficient insulin dose or Somogyi rebound, where blood glucose levels initially reach hypoglycemic levels and are brought to hyperglycemic ones by the body's counterregulatory hormones. Curves also provide evidence of insulin resistance which may be caused by medications other than insulin or by disorders other than diabetes which further testing can help identify.\nOther diagnostic tests to determine the level of diabetic control are fructosamine and glycated hemoglobin (GHb) blood tests which can be useful especially if stress may be a factor. While anxiety or stress may influence the results of blood or urine glucose tests, both of these tests measure glycated proteins, which are not affected by them. Fructosamine testing provides information about blood glucose control for an approximate 2- to 4-week period, while GHb tests measure a 2- to 4-month period. Each of these tests has its own limitations and drawbacks and neither are intended to be replacements for blood glucose testing and curves, but are to be used to supplement the information gained from them. While HbA1c tests are a common diagnostic for diabetes in humans, only recently has an A1C test become available for cats and dogs. The product is called A1CARE and is available from Baycom Diagnostics.\nThe diabetic pet is considered regulated when its blood glucose levels remain within an acceptable range on a regular basis. Acceptable levels for dogs are between 5 and 10 mmol/L or 90 to 180 mg/dL.

Basal and reduced insulin dose information should be part of initial doctor–client diabetes discussions in case of need.\nIt is possible to regulate diabetes without any diet change. If the animal will not eat a prescribed diet, it is not in the dog's best interest to insist on it; the amount of additional insulin required because a non-prescription diet is being fed is generally between 2–4%.

Urine glucose testing strips have a negative result until the renal threshold of 10 mmol/L or 180 mg/dL is reached or exceeded for a period of time. The range of negative reading values is quite wide-covering normal or close to normal blood glucose values with no danger of hypoglycemia (euglycemia) to low blood glucose values (hypoglycemia) where treatment would be necessary.

Reading the colors at those time intervals is important because the colors will continue to darken and a later reading will be an incorrect result. Timing with a clock or watch second hand instead of counting is more accurate.\nAt present, there is only one glucometer available for home use that tests blood for ketones using special strips for that purpose–Abbott's Precision Xtra. This meter is known as Precision, Optium, or Xceed outside of the US.  The blood ketone test strips are very expensive; prices start at about US$50 for ten strips. It is most likely urine test strips–either ones that test only for ketones or ones that test for both glucose and ketones in urine would be used.

It shares the symptoms of extreme hyperglycemia, dehydration, and lethargy with ketoacidosis; because there is some insulin in the system, the body does not begin to turn to using fat as its energy source and there is no ketone production. There is not sufficient insulin available to the body for proper uptake of glucose, but there is enough to prevent ketone formation. The problem of dehydration in NHS is more profound than in diabetic ketoacidosis. Seizures and coma are possible.

An insensible loss example is breathing because while there are some fluid losses, it is not possible to measure the amount of them. With a condition like fever, it is possible to measure the amount of fluid losses from it with a formula that increases by 7% for each degree of above normal body temperature, so it would be classed as a sensible loss.\nA check of the pet's gums and skin can indicate dehydration; gums become tacky and dry and skin does not snap back quickly when pinched if dehydration is present. When the skin at the back is lifted, a dehydrated animal's does not fall back into place quickly. Serious dehydration (loss of 10–12% of body fluids) means the pulled up skin stays there and does not go back into place. At this point, the animal may go into shock; dehydration of 12% or more is an immediate medical emergency. Hypovolemic shock is a life-threatening medical condition in which the heart is unable to pump sufficient blood to the body, due to loss of fluids.\nDehydration can change the way subcutaneous insulin is absorbed, so either hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia are possible; dehydration can also cause false negative or positive urine ketone test results.

Some common reasons for hypoglycemia include increased or unplanned exercise, illness, or medication interactions, where another medication potentiates the effects of the insulin. Vomiting and diarrhea episodes can bring on a hypoglycemia reaction, due to dehydration or simply a case of too much insulin and not enough properly digested food. Symptoms of hypoglycemia need to be taken seriously and addressed promptly. Since serious hypoglycemia can be fatal, it is better to treat a suspected incident than to fail to respond quickly to the signs of actual hypoglycemia. Dr. Audrey Cook addressed the issue in her 2007 article on diabetes mellitus: \"Hypoglycemia is deadly; hyperglycemia is not.

If the animal refuses it, a sugar solution (corn syrup, honey, pancake syrup, etc.) should be poured on the finger and rubbed on its gums or under the tongue (sublingually). The solution must be applied this way to prevent possible aspiration of it. Intervet suggests one tablespoon of a sugar solution rubbed onto the gums, regardless of the size of the dog. Another hypoglycemia formula is 1 gram of glucose for every kilogram (2.2 lb) of the animal's body weight. Since sugar acts quickly, a response should be seen within a minute or two.\nHoney, syrup, or sugar, as simple carbohydrates, act rapidly and will make the blood glucose rise, but the rise will not last very long, as they are broken down quickly by the body. Feeding something containing  complex carbohydrates when the pet is able to eat will make sure another hypoglycemia event does not overtake the rapid rise in blood glucose levels from the sugar solution. Complex carbohydrates take longer to be broken down by the body, so they do not raise blood glucose levels until some time after being eaten.  A small meal should be fed and the animal taken for medical evaluation to determine if further treatment is needed. Treatment of a serious hypoglycemia episode is similar to that of diabetic humans: using glucose or glucagon infusions, depending on severity. A part from the medicinal way, lifestyle management of the dog can also be considered when preventing a diabetes attack on the dog. Physical exercising activities such as homeopathy2, walking and swimming of the dog are suggested under behavioral management in treating diabetes because it results in tissue preservation.

The body's normal response to dehydration is to conserve water by concentrating the urine. Those with DI continue to urinate large amounts of dilute urine in spite of water deprivation. In primary polydipsia, the urine osmolality should increase and stabilize at above 280 mOsm/kg with fluid restriction, while a stabilization at a lower level indicates diabetes insipidus. Stabilization in this test means, more specifically, when the increase in urine osmolality is less than 30 Osm/kg per hour for at least three hours. Sometimes measuring blood levels of ADH toward the end of this test is also necessary, but is more time-consuming to perform.\nTo distinguish between the main forms, desmopressin stimulation is also used; desmopressin can be taken by injection, a nasal spray, or a tablet. While taking desmopressin, a person should drink fluids or water only when thirsty and not at other times, as this can lead to sudden fluid accumulation in the central nervous system. If desmopressin reduces urine output and increases urine osmolarity, the hypothalamic production of ADH is deficient, and the kidney responds normally to exogenous vasopressin (desmopressin). If the DI is due to kidney pathology, desmopressin does not change either urine output or osmolarity (since the endogenous vasopressin levels are already high).\nWhilst diabetes insipidus usually occurs with polydipsia, it can also rarely occur not only in the absence of polydipsia but in the presence of its opposite, adipsia (or hypodipsia). \"Adipsic diabetes insipidus\" is recognised as a marked absence of thirst even in response to hyperosmolality. In some cases of adipsic DI, the person may also fail to respond to desmopressin.\nIf central DI is suspected, testing of other hormones of the pituitary, as well as magnetic resonance imaging, particularly a pituitary MRI, is necessary to discover if a disease process (such as a prolactinoma, or histiocytosis, syphilis, tuberculosis or other tumor or granuloma) is affecting pituitary function. Most people with this form have either experienced past head trauma or have stopped ADH production for an unknown reason.", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_insipidus"}

More than one successive bite is often called a dog attack, although dog attacks can include knock-downs and scratches. Though some dog bites do not result in injury, they can result in infection, disfigurement, temporary or permanent disability, or death. Another type of dog bite is the \"soft bite\" displayed by well-trained dogs, by puppies, and in non-aggressive play. Dog bites can occur during dog fighting, as a response to mistreatment, by trained dogs working as guard, police or military animals, or during a random encounter.\nThere is debate on whether or not certain breeds of dogs are inherently more prone to commit attacks causing serious injury (i.e., so driven by instinct and breeding that, under certain circumstances, they are exceedingly likely to attempt or commit dangerous attacks). It is recognized that the risk of dog bites can be increased by human actions such as abuse or bite training, or through inaction such as neglect, carelessness in confinement or lack of control.\nSignificant dog bites affect tens of millions of people globally each year. It is estimated that 2% of the U.S. population,  4.5–4.7 million people, are bitten by dogs each year. Most bites occur in children, with nearly half of all children in the U.S. being bitten by a dog at least once by the age of 12. In the 1980s and 1990s, the U.S. averaged 17 deaths per year. Between 2011 and 2021 approximately 468 people were killed by dog bites in the United States, averaging 43 deaths per year.

Legislative bodies have addressed concerns about dog bites that include licensing laws, statutes outlawing organized dogfights, and leash laws. Breed-Specific Legislation (BSL) has been enacted in some areas, limiting the ownership and activities of dogs perceived to be more likely to bite and attack. Dog breeds targeted by breed-specific regulations include Rottweilers, American Staffordshire Bull Terriers (\"Pit Bulls\"), Chow Chows, German Shepherd Dogs, and Doberman Pinschers. Other measures in preventing dog bites are Beware of the dog signage and locked dog enclosures.\nSome people, like the very young or the very old, are more susceptible to being bitten and therefore may need additional methods of prevention.\nDogs can be extremely territorial and protective. Dogs can attack anyone who poses a threat to their companions, whether humans, other dogs, or even cats. Dogs can rival bears and big cats in ferocity when confronting burglars, even if they are ordinarily docile.\nIn addition to causing pain, injury, or nerve damage, almost one out of five bites becomes infected. Those who work and live around dogs should be aware of the risk and take precautions. Rabies is a particular risk associated with dog bites. According to the World Health Organization, 99% of the human rabies cases are caused by dogs. In the United States between 16,000 and 39,000 people come in contact with potentially rabid dogs and other animals and receive rabies pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis against the rabies virus each year. Because anyone who is bitten by an unvaccinated dog is at risk of getting rabies, local animal control agencies or police are sometimes able to capture the animal and determine whether or not it is infected with rabies.\nIdentifying the risk of being bitten by a dog can prevent an attack and subsequent injury or death. Infants and children are more likely to be bitten. Small children can be attacked if they approach or play with a dog when they are not supervised. Among children, the rate of dog-bite–related injuries is highest for those five to nine years old. Children are more likely than adults to need medical attention for dog bites. Men are more likely than women to be bitten by a dog. Over half of dog-bite injuries occur in the home. Having a dog in the household is associated with a higher likelihood of being bitten than not having a dog. As the number of dogs in the home increases, so does the likelihood of being bitten. Adults with two or more dogs in the household are five times more likely to be bitten than those living without dogs at home.\nThe behavior of a dog may not always indicate its friendliness or likelihood of biting. This is because when a dog wags its tail, most people interpret this as the dog expressing happiness and friendliness. Though indeed tail wagging can express these positive emotions, tail wagging is also an indication of fear, insecurity, anxiety, challenging of dominance, establishing social relationships, or a warning that the dog may bite.", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_bite"}

States that impose strict liability make the owner of a dog liable for injuries caused by a dog, without further consideration of the facts. Strict liability laws may require that the person seeking damages for a dog bite prove that they were acting peacefully and lawfully at the time of the bite. The law may also recognize a limited range of defenses to liability, such as the dog owner successfully proving that the injured person was trespassing at the time of the injury or had engaged in conduct that provoked the attack.

According to the International Emergency Medicine Education Project, severe hyperthermia (body temperature elevation of beyond 40 °C (104 °F)) \"becomes a medical emergency requiring immediate treatment to prevent disability or death\". Almost half a million deaths are recorded every year from hyperthermia.\nThe most common causes include heat stroke and adverse reactions to drugs. Heat stroke is an acute temperature elevation caused by exposure to excessive heat, or combination of heat and humidity, that overwhelms the heat-regulating mechanisms of the body. The latter is a relatively rare side effect of many drugs, particularly those that affect the central nervous system. Malignant hyperthermia is a rare complication of some types of general anesthesia. Hyperthermia can also be caused by a traumatic brain injury.\nHyperthermia differs from fever in that the body's temperature set point remains unchanged. The opposite is hypothermia, which occurs when the temperature drops below that required to maintain normal metabolism.

Human heat-loss mechanisms are limited primarily to sweating (which dissipates heat by evaporation, assuming sufficiently low humidity) and vasodilation of skin vessels (which dissipates heat by convection proportional to the temperature difference between the body and its surroundings, according to Newton's law of cooling). Other factors, such as insufficient water intake, consuming alcohol, or lack of air conditioning, can worsen the problem.\nThe increase in body temperature that results from a breakdown in thermoregulation affects the body biochemically. Enzymes involved in metabolic pathways within the body such as cellular respiration fail to work effectively at higher temperatures, and further increases can lead them to denature, reducing their ability to catalyse essential chemical reactions. This loss of enzymatic control affects the functioning of major organs with high energy demands such as the heart and brain. Loss of fluid and electrolytes cause heat cramps – slow muscular contraction and severe muscular spasm lasting between one and three minutes. Almost all cases of heat cramps involve vigorous physical exertion.

Ultraendurance athletes have been found to have significantly increased plasma endotoxin levels. Endotoxin stimulates many inflammatory cytokines, which in turn may cause multiorgan dysfunction. Experimentally, monkeys treated with oral antibiotics prior to induction of heat stroke do not become endotoxemic.\nThere is scientific support for the concept of a temperature set point; that is, maintenance of an optimal temperature for the metabolic processes that life depends on. Nervous activity in the preoptic-anterior hypothalamus of the brain triggers heat losing (sweating, etc.) or heat generating (shivering and muscle contraction, etc.) activities through stimulation of the autonomic nervous system. The pre-optic anterior hypothalamus has been shown to contain warm sensitive, cool sensitive, and temperature insensitive neurons, to determine the body's temperature setpoint. As the temperature that these neurons are exposed to rises above 37 °C (99 °F), the rate of electrical discharge of the warm-sensitive neurons increases progressively.

The effectiveness of evaporative cooling depends upon humidity. Wet-bulb temperature, which takes humidity into account, or more complex calculated quantities such as wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT), which also takes solar radiation into account, give useful indications of the degree of heat stress and are used by several agencies as the basis for heat-stress prevention guidelines. (Wet-bulb temperature is essentially the lowest skin temperature attainable by evaporative cooling at a given ambient temperature and humidity.)\nA sustained wet-bulb temperature exceeding 35 °C (95 °F) is likely to be fatal even to fit and healthy people unclothed in the shade next to a fan; at this temperature, environmental heat gain instead of loss occurs. A 2020 survey of weather station data shows that wet-bulb temperatures have exceeded 31 °C (88 °F) – 33 °C (91 °F) many times across the world, and have exceeded 35 °C (95 °F) multiple times in two stations. \nIn cases of heat stress caused by physical exertion, hot environments, or protective equipment, prevention or mitigation by frequent rest breaks, careful hydration, and monitoring body temperature should be attempted. However, in situations demanding one is exposed to a hot environment for a prolonged period or must wear protective equipment, a personal cooling system is required as a matter of health and safety. There are a variety of active or passive personal cooling systems; these can be categorized by their power sources and whether they are person- or vehicle-mounted.\nBecause of the broad variety of operating conditions, these devices must meet specific requirements concerning their rate and duration of cooling, their power source, and their adherence to health and safety regulations. Among other criteria are the user's need for physical mobility and autonomy. For example, active-liquid systems operate by chilling water and circulating it through a garment; the skin surface area is thereby cooled through conduction. This type of system has proven successful in certain military, law enforcement, and industrial applications. Bomb-disposal technicians wearing special suits to protect against improvised explosive devices (IEDs) use a small, ice-based chiller unit that is strapped to one leg; a liquid-circulating garment, usually a vest, is worn over the torso to maintain a safe core body temperature. By contrast, soldiers traveling in combat vehicles can face microclimate temperatures in excess of 65 °C (149 °F) and require a multiple-user, vehicle-powered cooling system with rapid connection capabilities.

Mild hyperthemia caused by exertion on a hot day may be adequately treated through self-care measures, such as increased water consumption and resting in a cool place. Hyperthermia that results from drug exposure requires prompt cessation of that drug, and occasionally the use of other drugs as counter measures.\nAntipyretics (e.g., acetaminophen, aspirin, other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) have no role in the treatment of heatstroke because antipyretics interrupt the change in the hypothalamic set point caused by pyrogens; they are not expected to work on a healthy hypothalamus that has been overloaded, as in the case of heatstroke. In this situation, antipyretics actually may be harmful in patients who develop hepatic, hematologic, and renal complications because they may aggravate bleeding tendencies.\nWhen body temperature is significantly elevated, mechanical cooling methods are used to remove heat and to restore the body's ability to regulate its own temperatures. Passive cooling techniques, such as resting in a cool, shady area and removing clothing can be applied immediately. Active cooling methods, such as sponging the head, neck, and trunk with cool water, remove heat from the body and thereby speed the body's return to normal temperatures. When methods such as immersion are impractical, misting the body with water and using a fan have also been shown to be effective.\nSitting in a bathtub of tepid or cool water (immersion method) can remove a significant amount of heat in a relatively short period of time. It was once thought that immersion in very cold water is counterproductive, as it causes vasoconstriction in the skin and thereby prevents heat from escaping the body core. However, a British analysis of various studies stated: \"this has never been proven experimentally. Indeed, a recent study using normal volunteers has shown that cooling rates were fastest when the coldest water was used.\" The analysis concluded that iced water immersion is the most-effective cooling technique for exertional heat stroke. No superior cooling method has been found for non-exertional heat stroke. Thus, aggressive ice-water immersion remains the gold standard for life-threatening heat stroke.\nWhen the body temperature reaches about 40 °C (104 °F), or if the affected person is unconscious or showing signs of confusion, hyperthermia is considered a medical emergency that requires treatment in a proper medical facility.

The main risk factor for hyperthermia is the lack of ability to sweat. People who are dehydrated or who are older may not produce the sweat they need to regulate their body temperature. High heat conditions can put certain groups at risk for hyperthermia including: physically active individuals, soldiers, construction workers, landscapers and factory workers. Some people that do not have access to cooler living conditions, like people with lower socioeconomic status, may have a difficult time fighting the heat. People are at risk for hyperthermia during high heat and dry conditions, most commonly seen in the summer.\nVarious cases of different types of hyperthermia have been reported. A research study was published in March 2019 that looked into multiple case reports of drug induced hyperthermia. The study concluded that psychotropic drugs such as anti-psychotics, antidepressants, and anxiolytics were associated with an increased heat-related mortality as opposed to the other drugs researched (anticholinergics, diuretics, cardiovascular agents, etc.). A different study was published in June 2019 that examined the association between hyperthermia in older adults and the temperatures in the United States. Hospitalization records of elderly patients in the US between 1991 and 2006 were analyzed and concluded that cases of hyperthermia were observed to be highest in regions with arid climates. The study discussed finding a disproportionately high number of cases of hyperthermia in early seasonal heat waves indicating that people were not yet practicing proper techniques to stay cool and prevent overheating in the early presence of warm, dry weather.\nIn urban areas people are at an increased susceptibility to hyperthermia. This is due to a phenomenon called the urban heat island effect. Since the 20th century in the United States, the north-central region (Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, Iowa, and Nebraska) was the region with the highest morbidity resulting from hyperthermia. Northeastern states had the next highest. Regions least affected by heat wave-related hyperthermia causing death were Southern and Pacific Coastal states. Northern cities in the United States are at greater risk of hyperthermia during heat waves due to the fact that people tend to have a lower minimum mortality temperature at higher latitudes. In contrast, cities residing in lower latitudes within the continental US typically have higher thresholds for ambient temperatures. In India, hundreds die every year from summer heat waves, including more than 2,500 in the year 2015. Later that same summer, the 2015 Pakistani heat wave killed about 2,000 people. An extreme 2003 European heat wave caused tens of thousands of deaths.\nCauses of hyperthermia include dehydration, use of certain medications, using cocaine and amphetamines or excessive alcohol use. Bodily temperatures greater than 37.5–38.3 °C (99.5–100.9 °F) can be diagnosed as a hyperthermic case. As body temperatures increase or excessive body temperatures persist, individuals are at a heightened risk of developing progressive conditions. Greater risk complications of hyperthermia include heat stroke, organ malfunction, organ failure, and death. There are two forms of heat stroke; classical heatstroke and exertional heatstroke. Classical heatstroke occurs from extreme environmental conditions, such as heat waves. Those who are most commonly affected by classical heatstroke are very young, elderly or chronically ill. Exertional heatstroke appears in individuals after vigorous physical activity. Exertional heatstroke is displayed most commonly in healthy 15-50 year old people.

{"condition": "Dog odor", "species": "dog", "section": "unlabelled", "paragraph_id": 1, "text": "Healthy odors\nAll natural dog odors are most prominent near the ears and from the paw pads. Dogs naturally produce secretions, the function of which is to produce scents allowing for individual animal recognition by dogs and other species in the scent-marking of territory. \nDogs only produce sweat on areas not covered with fur, such as the nose and paw pads, unlike humans who sweat almost everywhere. However, they do have sweat glands, called apocrine glands, associated with every hair follicle on the body.  The exact function of these glands is not known, but they may produce pheromones or chemical signals for communication with other dogs. It is believed that these sweat secretions produce an individual odor signal that is recognizable by other dogs.\nDogs also have sweat glands on their noses.  These are eccrine glands.  When these glands are active, they leave the nose and paw pads slightly moist and help these specialized skin features maintain their functional properties. The odor associated with dog paw pads is much more noticeable on dogs with moist paw pads than on those with dry pads.\nDogs also have numerous apocrine glands in their external ear canals. In this location, they are referred to as ceruminous glands.  The ear canals also have numerous sebaceous glands.  Together, these two sets of glands produce natural ear wax, or cerumen.  Micro-organisms live naturally in this material and give the ears a characteristic slightly yeasty odor, even when healthy. When infected, the ears can give off a strong disagreeable smell.  It is not uncommon for a veterinarian to sniff a dog's ears to try to detect any potential bacterial or fungal infection. Some owners do this routinely if they have a dog susceptible to ear infections or if they have a breed with heavy, floppy ears, which can hide early signs of inflammation.\nDogs, like all Carnivorans, also possess two anal sacs, or scent glands.  These sacs communicate with the surface of the skin by ducts which open on either side of the anus.  The sacs are lined with apocrine and sebaceous glands.  They function to produce a natural secretion that varies from thin and yellowish to pasty and greyish; the secretion has a very strong musky odor.  A small amount of this material is deposited when dogs defecate.  A large amount may be extruded when a dog is frightened.  It is thought that this secretion leaves a signal to other dogs allowing them to recognize the source of the individual fecal deposit.  This odor is also likely the signal being sampled when strange dogs investigate one another by sniffing out the anal area. Dogs' anal glands can become swollen and unable to drain naturally, sometimes requiring a visit to the veterinarian or groomer to express the built up liquid. Excessive licking and chewing of the area is one indication of this. Typically, these glands are expressed during routine professional grooming as a preventative measure.\nAnother source of natural odor results from a common dog behavior: rolling in and marking themselves with the feces of other animals in their environment.", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_odor"}

A coat that is not kept clean and groomed can trap dirt and other substances with unpleasant odors.\nSkin diseases can cause a dog to have increased or abnormal odor. Allergy can cause increased production of apocrine sweat, which imparts a musty odor. This condition, termed hyperhidrosis, can encourage yeast infection or bacterial skin infection and these micro-organisms produce odors as well. Dogs with seborrhea or keratinization defect, and dogs with deep skin folds (such as on the face of a bulldog), are very subject to secondary proliferation of bacteria or yeast on the skin surface, and these produce odors.\nEar disease (otitis) can be a source of odor that varies from yeasty to one resembling sewage as either cerumen or pus accumulates in the diseased ear canal. Anal sac disease or excessive anal sac production can cause a very musty pungent odor.  Anal sacs can become abscessed and infecting micro-organisms produce odor.\nDental disease or mouth ulcers can produce rotten smelling breath (halitosis). Dental calculus harbors numerous bacteria which produce odor and foul breath. Dental disease can also lead to excessive drooling, and the skin around the mouth can become infected, leading to more odor production. Dogs can also acquire foul smelling breath as a result of coprophagia, the practice of eating their own feces or the feces of other animals. Commercially prepared food additives can be purchased which, when added to a dog's food, impart a bitter flavor to their feces thereby reducing the tendency towards consuming their own feces.\nSome medications, such as antibiotics, taken by mouth or antiseptics or medicated shampoos used on the skin can produce odors that owners may find unpleasant. Likewise, some food ingredients, most noticeably fish meal or fish oil, can produce skin odor in dogs.\nFlatulence can be a problem for some dogs, which may be diet-related or a sign of gastrointestinal disease.  This, in fact, may be the most commonly noticed source of odor from dogs fed cereal-based dog foods.\nSkunks and dogs often have aggressive encounters and a dog may be sprayed by a skunk.

Dogs can be infested with contagious lice.\nOther ectoparasites, including flea and tick infestations are not considered directly contagious but are acquired from an environment where other infested hosts have established the parasite's life cycle.\nRingworm is a fungal infection that can be contagious to other dogs as well as humans. It is one of the most frequent skin diseases. A dog can become infected by direct contact with another infected dog, brushing up against a surface that an infected dog has touched, as well as coming in contact with species of ringworm that live in the soil. Ringworm is round, or ringed in shape. Symptoms of ringworm can include hair loss on the sections of the infected area(s), itchiness (may or may not occur), Ringworm tends to occur more in puppies than adult dogs. Ringworm is not a life-threatening condition but a veterinarian visit is usually needed in order to confirm the diagnosis and be prescribed a topical or oral medication for the ringworm.", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_skin_disorders"}

Omega 3 fatty acids are increasingly being used to treat pruritic, irritated skin. A group of dogs supplemented with omega 3 fatty acids (660 mg/kg [300 mg/lb] of body weight/d) not only improved the condition of their pruritus, but showed an overall improvement in skin condition. Furthermore, diets lacking in essential fatty acids usually present as matted and unkept fur as the first sign of a deficiency. Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), a well known omega 3, works by preventing the synthesis of another omega metabolite known as arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is an omega 6, making it pro-inflammatory. Though not always the case, omega 6 fatty acids promote inflammation of the skin, which in turn reduces overall appearance and health. There are skin benefits of both these lipids, as a deficiency in omega 6 leads to a reduced ability to heal and a higher risk of infection, which also diminishes skin health.

Like other scientists, he \"could not figure out what mechanism could account for the differences in anatomy, physiology, and behavior\" that were obvious in dogs, but he was confident that the answer lay \"in the principles of Mendelian inheritance.\"\nThe available research concluded that domesticated animals differ in several ways from their wild counterparts. Belyayev believed that many domesticated animals had a number of phenotypic traits in common. This hypothesis is called the domestication syndrome; it was challenged in 2019.\nScientists did not know what principle of selection had guided the Neolithic farmers who had first domesticated these species thousands of years ago. Belyayev's hypothesis was that \"all domesticated species had been selected for a single criterion: tameness.\" Belyayev further theorized that this attribute \"had dragged along with it most of the other features that distinguish domestic animals from their wild forebears, like droopy ears, patches of white in the fur and changes in skull shape.\" Jason Goldman of Scientific American said, \"Belyaev hypothesized that the anatomical and physiological changes seen in domesticated animals could have been the result of selection on the basis of behavioral traits. More specifically, he believed that tameness was the critical factor.\"\nAcademic Claudio J. Bidau wrote that Belyayev's suspicion was \"that domestication was ruled by a process of 'destabilizing selection' affecting mechanisms of ontogenetic neuroendocrine control, either directly or indirectly in response to the appearance of a factor of stress\", and that \"the key factor of domestication producing striking similar results in many species is selection for tameness.\"\nGoldman said Belyayev wondered if a breeding program that involved \"selecting for tameness and against aggression would result in hormonal and neurochemical changes, since behavior ultimately emerged from biology. Those hormonal and chemical changes could then be implicated in anatomy and physiology. It could be that the anatomical differences in domesticated dogs were related to the genetic changes underlying the behavioral temperament for which they selected (tameness and low aggression). He believed that he could investigate these questions about domestication by attempting to domesticate wild foxes.\" He decided to study the silver fox and to observe how the fox responds to selective pressures for tame behaviour.\nBelyayev chose the silver fox for his experiment, \"because it is a social animal and is related to the dog.\" The silver fox had, however, never before been domesticated. Belyayev designed a selective-breeding program for the foxes that was intended to reproduce a single major factor, namely \"a strong selection pressure for tamability\".

In 1952, she began to collect the tamest foxes from fur farms. They \"began with 30 male foxes and 100 vixens, most of them from a commercial fur farm in Estonia.\" From the beginning, Belyayev chose foxes solely for tameness, allowing only a tiny percentage of male offspring, and a slightly larger percentage of females, to breed. The foxes were not trained, in order to ensure that their tameness was a result of genetic selection and not of environmental influences. For the same reason, they spent most of their lives in cages and were permitted only brief encounters with human beings.\nBelyayev set down strict guidelines for the breeding program. Goldman said, \"Starting at one month of age, and continuing every month throughout infancy, the foxes were tested for their reactions to an experimenter. The experimenter would attempt to pet and handle the fox while offering it food. In addition, the experimenters noted whether the foxes preferred to spend time with other foxes, or with humans.\" After the fox had reached sexual maturity at an age of seven to eight months, \"they had their final test and assigned an overall tameness score.\" Among the factors that went into this score were the tendency \"to approach an experimenter standing at the front of its home pen\" and \"to bite the experimenters when they tried to touch it.\" \nAs reported on by Trut, the tests for tameness took the following form, which was still in use as of 2009: \"When a cub is one month old, an experimenter offers it food from his hand while trying to stroke and handle the cub. The cubs are tested twice, once in a cage and once while moving freely with other cubs in an enclosure, where they can choose to make contact either with the human experimenter or with another cub. The test is repeated monthly until the cubs are six or seven months old.\" At the age of seven or eight months, the cubs are given a tameness score and placed in one of three groups. The least domesticated are in Class III; those that allow humans to pet and handle them, but that do not respond to contact with friendliness, are in Class II; the ones that are friendly with humans are in Class I. After only six generations, Belyayev and his team had to add a higher category, Class IE, the \"domesticated elite\", which \"are eager to establish human contact, whimpering to attract attention and sniffing and licking experimenters like dogs. They start displaying this kind of behavior before they are one month old. By the 20th generation 35% were 'elite', and by the 30th generation 70% to 80% of the selected generation was 'elite'.\"\nOnce the foxes in each generation had been classified according to the latest research, only the least fearful and least aggressive foxes were selected for breeding. Goldman said, \"In each successive generation, less than 20 percent of individuals were allowed to breed\". The sole criterion for permitting them to breed was their tolerance of human contact.", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domesticated_silver_fox"}
{"condition": "Domesticated silver fox", "species": "dog", "section": "unlabelled", "paragraph_id": 4, "text": "Results\nIn 1978, Belyayev reported at an Invitational Lecture at the 14th International Congress of Genetics in Moscow the types of changes that were observed by Belyayev and Trut in the tame-selected foxes. As early as the second generation, counting from 1959, the tameness score of the selected population continued to increase every generation. Tail wagging was observed in one male fox by the fourth generation (1963). As early as 1962 changes in the animals' reproductive behavior started taking place. They found that some of the tame foxes were showing signs of proestrus, as early as October–November, as opposed to the normal time of January–March.\nBy 1972, some of the females were coming into estrus in the October–November period. The males, by contrast, were not ready for mating. By 1976, the tamest females mated as early as 20 December; some of the females gave birth and then mated again in March–April. In the tenth generation (1969), floppy ears appeared in a female cub, as well as a piebald coloration on other tame cubs consisting of patches of white and brown on the belly, tail, and paws. A small white star patch appeared in the middle of forehead of one cub also in the tenth generation. Other correlated changes in the domesticated foxes reported by Belyaev included a shortened tail, a shortening and widening of the skull, and the tail rolled over the back.\nThe changes manifested by the tame foxes over the generations, moreover, were not only behavioral but also physiological, just as Belyayev had expected. The first physiological change detected in the tame foxes was a lower adrenaline level. Belyayev and his team \"theorized that adrenaline might share a biochemical pathway with melanin, which controls pigment production in fur\", a hypothesis that has since been confirmed by research. After eight to ten generations, the tame foxes began to develop multi-colored coats, a trait found more in domesticated animals than in wild ones; this was followed by the development of \"floppy ears and rolled tails similar to those in some breeds of dog\". After 15 to 20 generations, a very small percentage of the tame foxes developed shorter tails and legs and underbites or overbites. The experimenters also discovered that the domesticated foxes show a fear response several weeks later than their wild counterparts, and that this delay is \"linked to changes in plasma levels of corticosteroids, hormones concerned with an animal's adaptation to stress\". After 12 generations of selective breeding, the corticosteroid level in the tame foxes' plasma was \"slightly more than half the level in a control group\". After 28 to 30 generations, \"the level had halved again.\" At the same time, the tame foxes' brains contained higher levels of serotonin. Moreover, tame male foxes' skulls gradually became narrower, more like those of females, and litters became \"on average, one cub larger\".\nAfter over 40 generations of breeding, in short, Belyayev produced \"a group of friendly, domesticated foxes who 'displayed behavioral, physiological, and anatomical characteristics that were not found in the wild population, or were found in wild foxes but with much lower frequency…. Many of the domesticated foxes had floppy ears, short or curly tails, extended reproductive seasons, changes in fur coloration, and changes in the shape of their skulls, jaws, and teeth. They also lost their 'musky fox smell'.\" It was Belyayev's view that these new attributes, which were extremely similar to the attributes of other domesticated animals, \"was the result of selection for amenability to domestication.\" His reasoning was that behavior is \"regulated by a fine balance between neurotransmitters and hormones at the level of the whole organism ... . Because mammals from widely different taxonomic groups share similar regulatory mechanisms for hormones and neurochemistry, it is reasonable to believe that selecting them for similar behavior – tameness – should alter those mechanisms, and the developmental pathways they govern, in similar ways.\"\nTrut wrote in 1999 \"that after 40 years of the experiment, and the breeding of 45,000 foxes, a group of animals had emerged that were as tame and as eager to please as a dog.\" Fitch described the tame foxes as \"incredibly endearing\". The New York Times wrote that they: \"were clean and quiet and made excellent house pets, though — being highly active — they preferred a house with a yard to an apartment. They did not like leashes, though they tolerated them.\" Ceiridwen Terrill of Concordia University, who described Belyayev's fox farm in 2012 as looking like a set of \"dilapidated army barracks\", with \"rows and rows of sheds that house about a hundred foxes each\", said that the foxes were so tame that when she reached into a cage to show one of them some affection, it plainly \"loved having its belly scratched\". Some of the foxes had even been trained to fetch and sit. So it was, in the words of Scientific American, that: \"selecting for a single behavioral characteristic — allowing only the tamest, least fearful individuals to breed — resulted in changes not only in behavior, but also in anatomical and physiological changes that were not directly manipulated.\"", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domesticated_silver_fox"}

Brian Hare, a biological anthropologist, wanted to study \"the unusual ability of dogs to understand human gestures\". Hare \"wanted to know if dogs' powerful rapport with humans was a quality that the original domesticators of the dog had selected for, or whether it had just come along with the tameness, as implied by Belyaev's hypothesis\". He discovered \"that the fox kits from Belyaev's domesticated stock did just as well as puppies in picking up cues from people about hidden food, even though they had almost no previous experience with humans.\"\nHare suggested that selection for tameness \"may have been sufficient to produce the unusual ability of dogs to use human communicative gestures\" and that the inability of wild wolves to pick up human cues is caused by their fear of humans. While Belyayev and his team \"didn't select for a smarter fox but for a nice fox\", Hare said, \"they ended up getting a smart fox.\"\nBelyayev's research, Hare further argues, has implications for the origins of human social behavior: \"Are we domesticated in the sense of dogs? No. But I am comfortable saying that the first thing that has to happen to get a human from an apelike ancestor is a substantial increase in tolerance toward one another. There had to be a change in our social system.\"\nUnderstanding the genetic reasons for wildness compared to tameness may provide more insight into human behaviour and how humans domesticated animals.

After his death, his experiment was continued by Trut, who brought international attention to it with a 1999 article in American Scientist. By that year, after 40 years and 45,000 foxes, the experimenters had a population of 100 foxes, the product of 30 to 35 generations of selection. Trut expressed the belief in that year that \"Belyayev would be pleased\" with the posthumous results of his experiment, which has \"compressed into a few decades an ancient process that originally unfolded over thousands of years\", causing \"the aggressive behavior of our herd's wild progenitors\" to \"entirely disappear\". The experimenters, she wrote, \"have watched new morphological traits emerge, a process previously known only from archaeological evidence.\" Trut suggested that the most important remaining question is \"just how much further our selective-breeding experiment can go\".\nThe collapse of the Soviet Union resulted in declining funds towards scientific research, complicating Belyayev's and Trut's research continuation. They had difficulties even keeping the foxes alive. Belyayev died in 1985 before he could salvage the institute, so Trut fought to maintain the fox research. The experiment was under the supervision of Lyudmila Trut, till her death on 9th October 2024.

Similar research was carried out in Denmark with American minks, producing the domestic mink. The project also bred the least-tameable foxes to study social behavior in canids. These foxes avoided human contact, as do their wild behavioral phenotypes.\nDetailed genetic and physiological studies on the foxes have been done by Trut and colleagues. For example, the star-shaped pattern was found to be controlled by one dominant gene that was incompletely penetrant, \"but its penetrance is significantly higher in offspring from tame mothers than from aggressive ones\". Trut reported that female foxes heterozygous for the gene controlling the star pattern also influenced the number of male cubs, increasing the number of males over the expected 50%. As the fox experiment has progressed over time, it was found that in general the number of male cubs increased over the expected 50% to approximately 54%.\nEarly in the experiment, Trut and Belyaev started comparing the hormonal responses of the tame and control foxes. They showed that selection for tame behavior caused the levels of 11-oxycorticosteroids in the blood to be reduced; selection had also caused the morphology of adrenal glands to change. Levels of the sex hormones estradiol and progesterone differed. Belyaev stated: \"Perhaps the most important observation emerging from this series of experiments is the fact that tame females exhibit statistically significant changes in certain neurochemical characteristics in such regions of the brain as the hypothalamus, midbrain, and hippocampus. The level of serotonin and its metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid turned out to be higher in tame than in unselected females. This fact fits the type of behavior, since serotonin is known to inhibit some kinds of aggression. Serotonin plays a role in the central regulation of the hypothalmic-hypophyseal-adrenal-sexual system. Thus, selection for tame behavior is associated with changes in both the central and peripheral mechanisms of the neuro-endocrine control of ontogeny.\"\nTrut and her colleagues have applied modern molecular techniques to the fox populations with the aim of not only identifying which genes are involved in domestication, but also in determining how changes in the fox genome compare to those of the domesticated dog. 400 canine microsatellites that are evenly distributed across the canine genome were analyzed in the fox genome. Based on amounts of homozygosity in both tame and aggressive foxes, it was found that there was no evidence of inbreeding between the two groups of foxes. In order to help understand the neurobiology of behavior, fox and dog orthologs of serotonin receptor genes were cloned. Using 320 microsatellites Trut and co-workers showed that all 16 fox autosomes and one X chromosome were covered, and that there was a high conservation of marker order between homologous regions of foxes and dogs, even though the fox genome has 16 pairs of metacentric autosomes and the dog has 37 pairs of acrocentric autosomes. Additional studies by these workers have shown that tameness and aggressiveness are associated with at least two loci.\nIn 2005, DNA microarrays were utilized to find the differences in genetic expression between domesticated, non-domesticated (farm-raised), and wild foxes. It was found that there was a difference of 40 gene expressions between the domesticated and non-domesticated foxes. Although there was a difference in the genes of the three groups, the experimenters did not look into the behavioural and functional consequences of these differences. In 2007, a system of measuring fox behavior was described that is expected to be useful in QTL mapping to explore the genetic basis of tame and aggressive behavior in foxes.", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domesticated_silver_fox"}

The experiments with rats and minks, however, proved successful, with the subjects becoming tame alongside the foxes. After Belyayev's death, his rat experiment was carried on by Irina Plyusnina. \"Siberian gray rats caught in the wild, bred separately for tameness and for ferocity\", reported The New York Times, \"have developed ... entirely different behaviors in only 60 or so generations\".

The most commonly seen species in veterinary medicine is Otodectes cynotis (Gk. oto=ear, dectes=biter, cynotis=of the dog). This species, despite its name, is also responsible for 90% of ear mite infections in felines.\nIn veterinary practice, ear mite infections in dogs and cats may present as a disease that causes intense itching in one or both ears, which in turn triggers scratching at the affected ear. An unusually dark colored ear wax (cerumen) may also be produced. Cats, as well as dogs with erect ears that have control over ear direction, may be seen with one or both ear pinnas held at an odd or flattened angle.\nThe most common lesion associated with ear mites is an open or crusted (\"scabbed\") skin wound at the back or base of the ear, caused by abrasion of the skin by hind limb claws, as the ear has been scratched in an attempt to relieve the itching. This lesion often becomes secondarily infected and crusted from ordinary skin bacteria, so that the common presentation of ear mites is such a wound appearing on the back or base of one or both ears. This is accompanied by the pinnal-pedal reflex that appears as reflex scratching motions of the hind limb when the ear is manipulated (this test is positive as well in other mite infections of the outside and rim of the ear pinnas in mange). When the ear mite infection is treated, such wounds resolve spontaneously, and this resolution may be speeded with application of topical antibiotics.\nThe most common ear mite (as well as mange mite) treatments currently use the antiparasitics ivermectin and selamectin, usually as topical preparations. Ivermectin is available as a direct water-based liquid that is squeezed into the ear canal and massaged at the base of the ear to distribute the medication. Selamectin is available as a once-a-month preparation that can be applied to the animal's skin, which prevents mite infestation over that time.", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear_mite"}

Relief, in terms of the cat or dog no longer scratching at its ears, will be noticeable within a few hours. However, since mite irritation is partly allergic (see scabies), symptoms may also outlive mites by weeks. Moreover, it may take topical antibiotics and several weeks to clear infected external wounds caused by scratching on the exterior surfaces of cat and dog ears.\nOptions for treating ear mites in rabbits are the related antiparasitics ivermectin and selamectin. Both of these antiparasitics have also been used with good effect in cats and dogs. A topical preparation of 0.01% ivermectin (Acarexx) can be used directly as an oil in cat ears, and the related new generation drug selamectin (brand name \"Revolution\") is available as a once-per-month skin treatment for both dogs and cats, which will prevent new mite infestation as well as a number of other parasitic diseases.

{"condition": "Echinococcosis", "species": "mixed", "section": "unlabelled", "paragraph_id": 0, "text": "Echinococcosis is a parasitic disease caused by tapeworms of the Echinococcus type. The two main types of the disease are cystic echinococcosis and alveolar echinococcosis. Less common forms include polycystic echinococcosis and unicystic echinococcosis.\nThe disease often starts without symptoms and this may last for years. The symptoms and signs that occur depend on the cyst's location and size. Alveolar disease usually begins in the liver but can spread to other parts of the body, such as the lungs or brain. When the liver is affected, the patient may experience abdominal pain, weight loss, along with yellow-toned skin discoloration from developed jaundice. Lung disease may cause pain in the chest, shortness of breath, and coughing.\nThe infection is spread when food or water that contains the eggs of the parasite is ingested or by close contact with an infected animal. The eggs are released in the stool of meat-eating animals that are infected by the parasite. Commonly infected animals include dogs, foxes, and wolves. For these animals to become infected they must eat the organs of an animal that contains the cysts such as sheep or rodents. The type of disease that occurs in human patients depends on the type of Echinococcus causing the infection. Diagnosis is usually by ultrasound though computer tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may also be used. Blood tests looking for antibodies against the parasite may be helpful as may biopsy.\nPrevention of cystic disease is by treating dogs that may carry the disease and vaccination of sheep. Treatment is often difficult. The cystic disease may be drained through the skin, followed by medication. Sometimes this type of disease is just watched. The alveolar form often requires surgical intervention, followed by medications. The medication used is albendazole, which may be needed for years. The alveolar disease may result in death.\nThe disease occurs in most areas of the world and currently affects about one million people. In some areas of South America, Africa, and Asia, up to 10% of certain populations are affected. In 2015, the cystic form caused about 1,200 deaths; down from 2,000 in 1990. The economic cost of the disease is estimated to be around US$3 billion a year. It is classified as a neglected tropical disease (NTD) and belongs to the group of diseases known as helminthiases (worm infections). It can affect other animals such as pigs, cows and horses.\nTerminology used in this field is crucial since echinococcosis requires the involvement of specialists from nearly all disciplines. In 2020, an international effort of scientists, from 16 countries, led to a detailed consensus on terms to be used or rejected for the genetics, epidemiology, biology, immunology, and clinical aspects of echinococcosis.", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echinococcosis"}

Most of these various methods try to prevent and control CE by targeting the major risk factors for the disease and the way it is transmitted. For instance, health education programs focused on cystic echinococcosis and its agents, and improved water sanitation attempt to target poor education and poor drinking water sources, which are both risk factors for contracting echinococcosis. Furthermore, since humans often come into contact with Echinococcus eggs via touching contaminated soil, animal feces and animal hair, another prevention strategy is improved hygiene. In addition to targeting risk factors and transmission, control and prevention strategies of cystic echinococcosis also aim at intervening at certain points of the parasite's life cycle, in particular, the infection of hosts (especially dogs) that reside with or near humans. For example, many countries endemic to echinococcosis have researched programs geared at de-worming dogs and vaccinating dogs and other livestock, such as sheep, that also act as hosts for E. granulosus.\nProper disposal of carcasses and offal after home slaughter is difficult in poor and remote communities and therefore dogs readily have access to offal from livestock, thus completing the parasite cycle of Echinococcus granulosus and putting communities at risk of cystic echinococcosis. Boiling livers and lungs that contain hydatid cysts for 30 minutes has been proposed as a simple, efficient, and energy- and time-saving way to kill the infectious larvae.", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echinococcosis"}

However, its distribution was not always like this. For instance, until the end of the 1980s, E. multilocularis endemic areas in Europe were known to exist only in France, Switzerland, Germany, and Austria. But during the 1990s and early 2000s, there was a shift in the distribution of E. multilocularis as the infection rate of foxes escalated in certain parts of France and Germany.\nAs a result, several new endemic areas were found in Switzerland, Germany, Austria, and surrounding countries such as the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic, and Italy. There is also evidence showing that the Baltic Countries are endemic areas.\nWhile alveolar echinococcosis is not extremely common, it is believed that in the coming years, it will be an emerging or re-emerging disease in certain countries as a result of E. multilocularis' ability to spread.\nUnlike the previous two species of Echinococcus, E. vogeli and E. oligarthrus are limited to Central and South America.

There has been mention of it in the Talmud. It was also recognized by ancient scholars such as Hippocrates, Aretaeus, Galen and Rhazes. The recommended treatments were based on herbs like thymus vulgaris and raw garlic. Although echinococcosis has been well known for the past two thousand years, it was not until the past couple of hundred years that real progress was made in determining and describing its parasitic origin. The first step towards figuring out the cause of echinococcosis occurred during the 17th century when Francesco Redi illustrated that the hydatid cysts of echinococcosis were of \"animal\" origin. Then, in 1766, Pierre Simon Pallas predicted that these hydatid cysts found in infected humans were larval stages of tapeworms.\nA few decades afterward, in 1782, Goeze accurately described the cysts and the tapeworm heads, while in 1786 E. granulosus was accurately described by Batsch. Half a century later, during the 1850s, Karl von Siebold showed through a series of experiments that Echinococcus cysts do cause adult tapeworms in dogs. Shortly after this, in 1863, E. multilocularis was identified by Rudolf Leuckart. Then, during the early to mid-1900s, the more distinct features of E. granulosus and E. multilocularis, their life cycles, and how they cause disease were more fully described as more and more people began researching and performing experiments and studies. While E. granulosus and E. multilocularis were both linked to human echinococcosis before or shortly after the 20th century, it was not until the mid-1900s that E. oligarthrus and E. vogeli were identified as and shown as being causes of human echinococcosis.\nTwo calcified objects recovered from a 3rd- to 4th-century grave of an adolescent in Amiens (Northern France) were interpreted as probable hydatid cysts. A study of remains from two 8,000-year-old cemeteries in Siberia showed the presence of echinococcosis.", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echinococcosis"}

Human echinococcosis is an infectious disease caused by the following species: E. granulosus, E. multilocularis, E. vogeli or E. oligarthrus.\nEchinococcus is triploblastic – it has three layers – outermost ectoderm, middle mesoderm, and inner endoderm. An anus is absent, and it has no digestive system. Its body is covered by tegument and the worm is divided into a scolex, a short neck, and three to six proglottids. Its body shape is ribbon-like.\nIn humans, Echinococcus spp. cause a disease called echinococcosis. The three types of echinococcosis are cystic echinococcosis caused by E. granulosus, alveolar echinococcosis caused by E. multilocularis, and polycystic echinococcosis caused by E. vogeli or E. oligarthrus. A worm's incubation period is usually long and can be up to 50 years. Cystic echinococcosis is mostly found in South and Central America, Africa, the Middle East, China, Italy, Spain, Greece, Russia, and the western United States (Arizona, New Mexico, and California).\nEchinococcosis is a zoonosis. The definitive hosts are carnivorous predators – dogs, wolves, foxes, and lions. The adult tapeworm lives in their small intestines and delivers eggs to be excreted with the stool. The intermediate hosts are infected by ingesting eggs. Sheep, goats, cattle, camels, pigs, wild herbivores, and rodents are the usual intermediate hosts, but humans can also be infected. Humans are dead-end hosts, since their corpses are nowadays seldom eaten by carnivorous predators.\nThe egg hatches in the digestive system of the intermediate host, producing a planula larva. It penetrates the intestinal wall and is carried by bloodstream to liver, lung, brain, or another organ. It settles there and turns into a bladder-like structure called hydatid cyst. From the inner lining of its wall, protoscoleces (i.e. scoleces with invaginated tissue layers) bud and protrude into the fluid filling the cyst.\nAfter the death of the normal intermediate host, its body can be eaten by carnivores suitable as definitive hosts. In their small intestines, protoscoleces turn inside out, attach, and give rise to adult tapeworms, completing the lifecycle.  In humans, the cysts persist and grow for years. They are regularly found in the liver (and every possible organ: spleen, kidney, bone, brain, tongue and skin) and are asymptomatic until their growing size produces symptoms or are accidentally discovered. Disruption of the cysts (spontaneous or iatrogenic e.g. liver biopsy) can be life-threatening due to anaphylactic shock.\nCysts are detected with ultrasound, X-ray computed tomography, or other imaging techniques.

Dogs, both domestic and wild, act as reservoir hosts for this pathogen and are the primary hosts of brown dog ticks. Brown dog ticks become carriers of the pathogen when they take a blood meal from a rickessemic dog. Stored in the midgut and salivary glands of an infected tick, E. canis is transferred by the saliva of ticks carrying the pathogen to hosts during blood meals. If infected while in the larval stage, the tick retains the pathogen through the next two life stages and can infect hosts during blood meals in both the nymphal and adult stages in transstadial transmission.\nBecause the vector of E. canis uses canine species as a primary host, this bacterium is most commonly associated with dogs, but multiple human cases have been reported.  Additionally, some cats have been found to have antibodies to E. canis suggesting that it can occasionally infect cats, as well.", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ehrlichia_canis"}

The lack of these two materials reduces the rigidity of the cell wall, allowing the cell wall's exterior to be dynamic, in turn facilitating the E. canis cells’ evasion of antibodies in its host organism's body.\nThe cells of E. canis lack complex internal structures, which allow the synthesis of sugars and it, in turn, uses amino acids as its source of energy.\nUpon introduction, E. canis penetrates the monocytes and macrophages of hosts.

A low packed cell volume in the blood is a common indicator of the presence of E. canis and a blood smear can be done to determine if morulae are present in leukocytes to definitively diagnose the infection. Because this process is often long and tedious, the presence of antibodies to E. canis in blood can be used to effectively diagnose a patient. These antibodies typically appear within seven days after infection.\nE. canis is commonly treated via chemoprophylaxis with doxycycline, a prescription drug used in the treatment of bacterial infections. If caught before the clinical stage, E. canis is almost completely curable, but prolonged presence of the bacteria leads to hemorrhaging, which typically results in the death of the patient.\nAlthough no vaccine is known to be on the market for ehrlichiosis caused by E. canis, extensive research on the use of an attenuated strain of E. canis as an aid in the prevention of E. canis infection is being performed. Preliminary testing has proved that this method may be effective, as clinical signs and the presence of the E. canis bacteria were reduced in Beagle test subjects, but further investigations are necessary before a vaccine can be marketed.", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ehrlichia_canis"}

Other common causes of elbow dysplasia include an ununited anconeal process (UAP) and fragmented or ununited medial coronoid process (FCP or FMCP).\nOsteochondritis dissecans is difficult to diagnose clinically as the animal may only exhibit an unusual gait. Consequently, OCD may be masked by, or misdiagnosed as, other skeletal and joint conditions such as hip dysplasia. The problem develops in puppyhood, although often is subclinical, and there may be pain or stiffness, discomfort on extension, or other compensating characteristics. Diagnosis generally depends on X-rays, arthroscopy, or MRI scans. While cases of OCD of the stifle go undetected and heal spontaneously, others are exhibited in acute lameness.

The cartilage continues to grow and may split or become necrotic. The cause is uncertain, but possibly includes genetics, trauma, and nutrition (including excessive calcium and decreased vitamin C intake). OCD lesions found in the elbow at the medial epicondyle of the humerus are caused by disturbed endochondral fusion of the epiphysis of the medial epicondyle with the distal end of the humerus, which may in turn be caused by avulsion of the epiphysis. Specific conditions related to OCD include fragmentation of the medial coronoid process of the ulna (FMCP) and an ununited anconeal process of the ulna (UAP).  All types of OCD of the elbow are most typically found in large breed dogs, with symptoms starting between the ages of 4 and 8 months.  Males are affected twice as often as females.  The disease often affects both elbows (30 to 70 percent of the time), and symptoms include intermittent lameness, joint swelling, and external rotation and abduction of the paw.  Osteoarthritis will develop later in most cases.\nUAP is caused by a separation from the ulna of the ossification center of the anconeal process.

The dogs are exercised regularly and given pain medication, and between the ages of 12 and 18 months the lameness will often improve or disappear.  Control of body weight is important in all cases of elbow dysplasia, and prevention of quick growth spurts in puppies may help to prevent the disease.\nSurgery for FMCP consists of removal of cartilage and bone fragments and correction of any incongruity of the joint.  Reattachment of UAP with a screw is usually attempted before the age of 24 weeks, and after that age the typical treatment is removal of the UAP.  Without surgery, UAP rapidly progresses to osteoarthritis, but with FMCP osteoarthritis typically occurs with or without surgery.

{"condition": "Elongated soft palate", "species": "dog", "section": "unlabelled", "paragraph_id": 0, "text": "An elongated soft palate is a congenital hereditary disorder that negatively affect dogs and cats' breathing and eating. A soft palate is considered elongated when it extends past the top of the epiglottis and/or past the middle of the tonsillar crypts. The soft palate is made up of muscle and connective tissue located in the posterior portion on the roof of the mouth. The soft palate creates a barrier between the mouth (oral cavity) and nose (nasal cavity). This continuation between the cavities makes it possible to chew and breathe at the same time. The soft palate only blocks the nasal cavity while swallowing. At rest the soft palate should only stretch caudally from the hard palate to the tip of the epiglottis leaving an opening between the nasal and oral cavities. When the soft palate is elongated, it partially blocks the throat thereby creating breathing and feeding-related issues. The elongation and other accompanying symptoms occur in breeds characterized with \"smooshed faces\" such as pugs, bulldogs, and Persian cats. This condition is a congenital, meaning it is present when the animal is born. The \"smooshed\" characteristics is the result of a genetic mutation. The animal's genetic code causes the bones in their skull to grow to a smaller size. Because the bones are smaller, muscles and other tissues that surround the bones of the skull are out of proportion. These animals are often referred to as brachycephalic, derived from the Greek words for \"short\" and \"head\". An elongated soft palate is a symptom of Brachycephalic Obstructive Airway Syndrome (BOAS) and is common in brachycephalic dog breeds and has been reported in brachycephalic cat breeds as well.

CO2 laser surgery causes little to no bleeding and it is a quicker procedure when compared to other treatment methods. Sutures are often not required.

If the volvulus is greater than 180°, the esophagus is closed off, thereby preventing the animal from relieving the condition by belching or vomiting. The results of this distortion of normal anatomy and gas distension include hypotension (low blood pressure), decreased return of blood to the heart, ischemia (loss of blood supply) of the stomach, and shock. Pressure on the portal vein decreases blood flow to liver and decreases the ability of that organ to remove toxins and absorbed bacteria from the blood.

Perfusion and blood pressure need to be normalised before any further treatment can be performed. Analgesia should also be provided.\nPatients require intravenous fluid therapy with saline. Colloid fluids may be required if the patient does not respond well to the crystalloid solution. Antiarrhythmic drugs should be administered after starting fluid therapy to stabilise blood pressure. Other drugs such as dobutamine should be provided if blood pressure fails to normalise, only as a last resort. Other vasopressors can be used such as ephedrine, phenylephrine, and epinephrine.\nPercutaneous decompression is the easiest method of treating GDV. A large catheter is inserted into the gastric lumen. If done incorrectly the spleen may be lacerated or punctured. Potentially the content of the stomach may leak if the procedure is performed incorrectly.\nOrogastric intubation is another method for treatment. An orogastric tube is entered into the stomach via the oesophageal sphincter, tepid water is sent as a bolus through the tube into the stomach to lavage it. Fluid should be regurgitated up the tube. If it is not then a stomach perforation has likely occurred. \nTo restore the stomach to the normal position an exploratory laparotomy (explap) is needed. Sometimes a gastrectomy may be required. During the explap the stomach is rotated up to 360° to put it back into the right position, although typically such extreme rotation is not needed. Pulling on the pylorus allows for the stomach to be repositioned. Sometimes the dilatation is serious enough that the stomach requires further decompression before repositioning. Other organs of the digestive system are assessed during the procedure. Splenectomy may be required. Gastropexy involves suturing the pyloric antrum to the abdominal wall to prevent recurrence of GDV.

The worms require the mosquito as an intermediate host to complete their lifecycles. The rate of development in the mosquito is temperature-dependent, requiring about two weeks of temperature at or above 27 °C (80 °F). Below a threshold temperature of 14 °C (57 °F), development cannot occur, and the cycle is halted. As a result, transmission is limited to warm weather, and duration of the transmission season varies geographically. The period between the initial infection when the dog is bitten by a mosquito and the maturation of the worms into adults living in the pulmonary arteries takes six to seven months in dogs and is known as the \"prepatent period\".\nThe first larval stage (L1) and second larval stage (L2) of heartworm development occurs within the body of a mosquito. Once the larvae develop into the infective third larval stage (L3), the mosquito locates and bites a host, depositing the larvae under the skin at the site of the bite. After a week or two of further growth, they molt into the fourth larval stage (L4) . Then, they migrate to the muscles of the chest and abdomen, and 45 to 60 days after infection, molt to the fifth stage (L5, immature adult). Between 75 and 120 days after infection, these immature heartworms then enter the bloodstream and are carried through the heart to reside in the pulmonary artery. Over the next three to four months, they increase greatly in size. The female adult worm is about 30 cm in length, and the male is about 23 cm, with a coiled tail. By seven months after infection, the adult worms have mated and the females begin giving birth to live young, called microfilariae. Heartworms can live for 5 to 7 years in a dog.\nThe microfilariae circulate in the bloodstream for as long as two years, and are ingested by bloodsucking mosquitos, where development occurs and the cycle repeats.", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirofilaria_immitis"}

Most compromises in protection result from the failure to properly administer the drugs during seasonal transmission periods. In regions where the temperature is consistently above 14 °C (57 °F) year-round, a continuous prevention schedule is recommended.\nDue to newly emerging resistant strains of heartworms, which no macrocyclic lactone (heartworm prevention) can protect against, the American Heartworm Society recommends dogs be on a repellent and a heartworm preventive. The repellent, such as Vectra 3-D, keeps mosquitoes from feeding on the dog and transmitting the L3 stage worms. If a dog is bitten, the heartworm preventive takes over when administered. If a mosquito feeds on a heartworm positive dog on a repellent, they do not live long enough for the microfilaria they ingested to molt into the infective L3 larva. Vectra 3-D was tested using thousands of mosquitoes infected with the resistant heartworm strain JYD34. In the control group that was given only a placebo, every dog contracted heartworms. In the experimental group that was given only Vectra 3-D, two of eight dogs contracted heartworms and had an average of 1.5 adult worms each. In the experimental group given both heartworm prevention and Vectra 3-D, one dog was infected with L3 stage larvae that did not mature into adulthood due to the heartworm prevention. Using a repellent and a prevention is at least 95% effective.\nIvermectin, even with lapses up to four months between doses, still provides 95% protection from adult worms. This period is called the reach-back effect. Since dogs are susceptible to heartworms, they should be tested annually before they start preventive treatment. Annual heartworm testing is highly recommended for pet owners who choose to use minimal dosing schedules. Testing a dog annually for heartworms and other internal parasites is a fundamental part of a complete heartworm prevention program, and is also recommended for dogs who are already on a monthly prevention program.", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirofilaria_immitis"}

Like in dogs, a positive ELISA test for heartworm antigen is a very strong indication of infection. However, the likelihood of a positive antigen test depends on the number of adult female worms present. If only male worms are present, the test will be negative. Even with female worms, an antigen test usually only becomes positive seven to eight months after infection. Therefore, a cat may have significant clinical signs long before the development of a positive test. Heartworm-associated respiratory disease can be found in cats that never develop adult heartworms and therefore never have a positive antigen test.\nAn antibody test is also available for feline heartworm infection. It will be positive in the event of exposure to D. immitis, so a cat that has successfully eliminated an infection may still be positive for up to three months. The antibody test is more sensitive than the antigen test, but it does not provide direct evidence of adult infection. It can, however, be considered specific for diagnosing previous larval infections, and therefore fairly specific for heartworm-associated respiratory disease.\nX-rays of the chest of a heartworm-infected cat may show an increased width of the pulmonary arteries and focal or diffuse opacities in the lungs. Echocardiography is a fairly sensitive test in cats.

The nodule itself may be large enough to resemble lung cancer on the X-ray, and requires a biopsy for a pathologic assessment. This has been shown to be the most significant medical consequence of human infection by the canine heartworm. Patients are infected with the parasite through the bite of an infected mosquito, which is the same mechanism that causes heartworm infection in dogs.\nD. immitis is one of many species that can cause infection in dogs and humans. It was thought to infect the human eye, with most cases reported from the southeastern United States. However, these cases are now thought to be caused by a closely related parasite of raccoons, Dirofilaria tenuis. Several hundred cases of subcutaneous infections in humans have been reported in Europe, but these are almost always caused by another closely related parasite, Dirofilaria repens, rather than the dog heartworm. There are proven D. immitis infections, but humans rarely get infected with heartworms due to the larvae never fully maturing. When the heartworm infective larvae migrate through the skin, they often die since heartworms cannot survive in a human host, even if they make it into the bloodstream. Once the heartworms die, the immune system in the human body reacts to their tissue with inflammation as it tries to destroy the heartworms. When this happens, the condition is called pulmonary dirofilariasis.

{"condition": "Hip dysplasia (canine)", "species": "dog", "section": "unlabelled", "paragraph_id": 2, "text": "Dysplastic hip anatomy\nThe hip could have major contractions from dysplasias. The caput is not deeply and tightly held by the acetabulum. Instead of being a snug fit, it is a loose fit, or a partial fit. Secondly, the caput or acetabulum are not smooth and round, but are misshapen, causing abnormal wear and tear or friction within the joint as it moves.\nThe body reacts to this in several ways. First, the joint is continually repairing itself and laying down new cartilage. However, cartilage repair is a relatively slow process, the tissue being avascular, so the joint may suffer degradation due to the abnormal wear and tear, or may not support the body weight as intended. The joint becomes inflamed and a cycle of cartilage damage, inflammation and pain commences. This is a self-fueling process, in that the more the joint becomes damaged, the more damage it will cause to the surrounding tissues and bones. The inflammation also causes further damage. The bones of the joint may also develop osteoarthritis, visible on a radiograph as small outcrops of bone, which further degrade the joint. Osteoarthritis is a degenerative disease marked by the breakdown of cartilage between joints resulting in painful bone-to-bone contact.\nThe underlying deformity of the joint may get worse over time, or may remain static. A dog may have good radiographs and yet be in pain, or may have very poor radiographs and have no apparent pain issues. The hip condition is only one factor to determine the extent to which dysplasia is causing pain or affecting the quality of life. In mild to moderate dysplasia it is often the secondary effects of abnormal wear and tear or arthritis, rather than dysplasia itself, which is the direct causes of visible problems.", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canine_hip_dysplasia"}

Large and giant breeds are most susceptible to hip dysplasia (possibly due to the body mass index (BMI) of the individual animal), though many other breeds can suffer from it. The Orthopedic Foundation for Animals maintains a list of top 100 breeds affected.\nTo reduce pain, the animal will typically reduce its movement of that hip. This may be visible as \"bunny hopping\", where both legs move together, or less dynamic movement (running, jumping), or stiffness. Since the hip cannot move fully, the body compensates by adapting its use of the spine, often causing spinal, stifle (a dog's knee joint), or soft tissue problems to arise.\nThe causes of hip dysplasia are considered heritable, but new research conclusively suggests that environment also plays a role. To what degree the causality is genetic and what portion environmental is a topic of current debate. Neutering a dog, especially before the dog has reached an age of full developmental maturity, has been shown to almost double the chance he or she will develop hip dysplasia versus intact dogs or dogs that were neutered after reaching adulthood. Other environmental influences include overweight condition, injury at a young age, overexertion on the hip joint at a young age, ligament tear at a young age, or repetitive motion on forming joint (e.g. jogging with puppy under the age of 1 year). As current studies progress, greater information may help provide procedures to effectively reduce the occurrence of this condition.\nIt is most common in medium-large pure bred dogs, such as Newfoundlands, German Shepherd Dogs, retrievers (such as Labradors, Tollers, or Goldens), Rottweilers and Mastiffs, but also occurs in some smaller breeds such as spaniels and pugs.", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canine_hip_dysplasia"}

This procedure is not indicated if osteoarthritis is already present.

It usually restores complete mobility if no other joint is affected, and also completely prevents recurrence.

Hip replacement is also the preferred clinical option for serious dysplasia in animals that weigh 40–60 lb (18–27 kg).\nJuvenile pubic symphysiodesis (JPS) is a procedure for very young dogs that manipulates the way the pelvis grows to create a tighter hip. It involves cauterizing the growth plates of the pelvis to halt vertical growth. To compensate, the rest of the pelvis grows outward, in a manner which enhances the \"socket\" of the hip and provides better support than the dog would have had naturally.

The earliest known relationship between dogs and humans is attested by the 1914 discovery of the Bonn–Oberkassel dog, who was buried alongside two humans in modern-day Oberkassel, Germany, approximately 15,000 years ago. For centuries, the phrase \"man's best friend\" has commonly been used to refer to dogs, as they were the first species and the only large carnivore to have been domesticated. This companionship is most evident in Western countries, such as the United States, where 44% of households were found to be keeping at least one dog as a pet.\nOn average, female humans tend to have more positive attitudes towards dogs than male humans do, but studies have demonstrated that both dogs and humans release oxytocin while spending quality time together. This release of oxytocin is correlated with the formation of a strong social bond. Canines are capable of distinguishing between positive and negative human facial expressions and will react accordingly. Dogs appear in religions all over the world, particularly in Mesoamerican folklore and myth, thus signifying the deep reverence that humans all over the world have had and continue to have for them. Despite this relationship's significance throughout history, it is not necessarily always a positive one; dogs can be viewed in an extremely negative light, depending on the region.", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93canine_bond"}

Some examples of behaviors that led scientists to this conclusion is the display of proximity seeking behavior where the canine will seek out its caretaker as a means to cope with stress, and consequently the absence of the caretaker will trigger separation anxiety to a varying degree.  Another such behavior is the safe haven effect, which describes when the canine more freely explores novel objects in the caretaker's presence. Canines are capable of assessing humans' emotional states, as well as discriminating humans by levels of familiarity.\nStudies have demonstrated that shelter dogs benefit from interacting with complete strangers. These interactions result in a reduction in plasma cortisol, which is correlated to an overall reduction in stress. These results demonstrate the canines' innate desire to form an attachment with a human, and also demonstrate the positive health effects for the canine associated with the relationship.\nUpon loss, due to death or retirement, the majority of caregivers report intense feelings of grief.", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93canine_bond"}

His discovery was further reinforced by Sam and Elizabeth Corson, who were among the first to research and evaluate pet-facilitated therapy.\nIn the early 1980s the term 'human–animal bond' was officially coined by Leo K. Bustad, who delivered a summary lecture on the Human–Pet Relationship on October 28, 1983, at the International Symposium in Vienna. This symposium was held in honour of Konrad Lorenz, and during his lecture, Bustad praised him for his work on the human–animal bond and encouraged others to build on Lorenz's work on the subject. In the early 1970s, Konrad Lorenz had developed the field of ethology with his landmark research on the imprinting of behaviors in geese.\nBustad and other pet therapy advocates formed the Delta Society, which was built on the earlier work of Levinson and Croson. In the 1970s and 1980s, national and international conferences led to greater recognition of the human–animal bond.

In certain situations, other cells, such as monocytes, eosinophils, and neutrophils, can be involved. After antigen exposure, an initial local immune and inflammatory response occurs that attracts leukocytes. The antigen engulfed by the macrophages and monocytes is presented to T cells, which then becomes sensitized and activated. These cells then release cytokines and chemokines, which can cause tissue damage and may result in illnesses.\nExamples of illnesses resulting from type IV hypersensitivity reactions include contact dermatitis and drug hypersensitivity. Type IV reactions are further subdivided into type IVa, IVb, IVc, and IVd based on the type of T cell (Th1, Th17, and CTLs) involved and the cytokines/chemokines produced.\nDelayed hypersensitivity plays a crucial role in our body's ability to fight various intracellular pathogens such as mycobacteria and fungi.

The presence and level of severity of symptoms vary based on levels of growth hormone excess and duration of excess secretion. In dogs the manifestation of symptoms varies much more than with cats, some dogs may only show signs of acromegaly whilst others show mostly symptoms of diabetes mellitus. It is possible that this variability is related to breed. Diabetes, however, still occurs in a substantial number of dogs.\nMost symptoms result from the diabetogenic effect of growth hormone and the acral enlargement effects of growth hormone and IGF-1. Neurological signs may be observed in some cats due to expansion of the tumour, this can occur in dogs with pituiary tumours too. The most common symptoms in cats are polyuria, polydipsia, and polyphagia due to diabetes mellitus; however, polyphagia can be the result of growth hormone excess itself. Other symptoms in both cats and dogs include ataxia, asthenia, hepatomegaly, visceromegaly, enlargement of head and distal extremities, heart murmur, degenerative atrophy, thickening of skin and fur, stridor and a plantigrade stance in cats. Disruption of the central nervous system occurs in 10–15% of cases, potential signs of this include: adipsia,  lethargy, behavioural change, vision impairment, anorexia, temperature dysregulation, somnolence, stupor, and seizures. Less common but occasional symptoms include erythrocytosis, leukocytosis, and proteinuria.\nThe physical changes of hypersomatotropism are a result of anabolic effects of growth hormone and IGF-1; these have a gradual onset and progress slowly. The overgrowth of soft tissue and bone changes cause weight gain, broadening of the skull, prognathia inferior, and an enlarged tongue. Thickening of the oropharyngeal tissue may lead to respiratory distress and stridor. Degenerative anthropathy is caused by proliferation of chondrocytes and changes to the joint geometry.\nHeart murmur occurs in most feline cases, further diagnostics may reveal cardiomegaly and other heart abnormalities. Congestive heart failure can occur during later stages of the disease.\nA 1990 study reported 50% of cats diagnosed with hypersomatotropism had developed renal failure within 8–36 months of initial examination; however, another study from 2007 found a 12% incidence of azotaemia. Renal failure is a very common disease in elderly cats and it is controversial as to whether or not feline hypersomatotropism affects the development of renal failure.\nIn dogs the symptoms of diabetes mellitus commonly overshadows acromegalic symptoms.", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersomatotropism_(veterinary)"}

In 1980 a crossbred Belgian Shepherd bitch with acromegaly that had been administered excessive amounts of medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA); following cessation of MPA administration symptoms improved and hormone levels returned to normal. In 1981 it was reported that fifteen bitches receiving MPA injections to prevent oestrus. All fifteen showed signs of acromegaly and thirteen showed hyperglycaemia. Clinical signs were improved after cessation of MPA. Later studies would confirm an association between progestogen administration and acromegaly, glucose intolerance, and diabetes mellitus.", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersomatotropism_(veterinary)"}

Both dense and sparse granulated cells has been observed in the adenomas of cats with diabetes mellitus and elevated IGF-1 levels; however, it is not known whether this is because of different variants of the disease or not. It is also not known what percentage of tumours are mixed or  plurihormonal tumours. This information has only been reported in studies with a small number of cases.\nIn dogs growth hormone is not just derived from the anterior pituitary gland, it also derives from the mammary gland. Mammary gland production of growth hormone is stimulated by progestogen, this occurs naturally in intact bitches. Synthetic progestogens can cause excessive growth hormone secretion and higher IGF-1 levels which may lead to acromegaly and diabetes mellitus. Progestogens are used to prevent oestrus in bitches and to treat certain hyperplasias. Growth hormone excess can occur in the luteal phase of the oestrous cycle in older bitches.\nSomatotrophic adenomas have only been described in two dogs. In 1996 a 9-year-old male Doberman Pinscher with difficult to manage diabetes mellitus but no signs of acromegaly was euthanised. Necropsy later revealed an acidophilic adenoma with immunohistochemical staining for growth hormone, adrenocorticotropic hormone, and prolactin. In 2007 a 10-year-old male Dalmatian dog was described with acromegalic signs such as an enlarged tongue and head, widened interdental space, and thickening of skin; along with other signs of hypersomatotropism such as polyphagia, obesity, and stridor. Insulin levels were heightened and the dog had glucose intolerance; however, the dog was not diabetic as blood glucose levels were found to be normal after multiple tests. Levels of IGF-1 and growth hormone were heightened. CT imaging showed a pituitary mass which was later confirmed to be an acidophilic adenoma stained for growth hormone; however, mammary tumour-induced acromegaly is rare with few reported cases.\nHypothyroidism can increase levels of growth hormone and IGF-1 in dogs.

Growth hormone directly and indirectly affects the metabolic system; stimulation of IGF-1 synthesis is the indirect cause. Increased levels of growth hormone and IGF-1 result in proliferation of bone, cartilage, soft tissue, and increases the size of organs. These changes are responsible for the physical changes of hypersomatotropism that are characteristic to the condition.\nBoth growth hormone and IGF-1 can impact insulin in different manners. Chronic growth hormone excess has been linked to defects in hepatic and extrahepatic insulin actions. Growth hormone increases hepatic glucose production and decreases glucose uptake in extrahepatic tissue. Studies have suggested that growth hormone excess reduces insulin sensitivity. IGF-1 increases insulin sensitivity in both hepatic and extrahepatic tissue; however, in hypersomatotropism IGF-1 levels are unable to deal with the insulin resistance caused by excessive growth hormone levels.\nIn non-diabetic cases the insulin resistance is countered by increased insulin production from beta cells, which results in normoglycaemia (normal levels of blood sugar) being maintained. When beta cells fail to provide enough insulin production to compensate for the increased resistance diabetes mellitus develops. The cause for this failure is unknown. The vast majority of cats with hypersomatotropism also have diabetes mellitus.\nIn iatrogenic cases of hypersomatotropism, when the condition is caused by administered progestogens, the typical features of acromegaly occur; however, glucose tolerance is maintained initially by increased insulin levels, eventually insulin levels cannot be increased any further and glucose intolerance occurs. Most abnormalities are reversible after cessation of treatment; however, bone lesions may be permanent.\nIncrease in growth hormone and IGF-1 levels in bitches is a physiological event that occurs during the luteal phase of the oestrous cycle. In bitches with spontaneous acromegaly brought on by oestrous, their progesterone levels are normal; however, growth hormone levels are increased. Recovery following an ovariohysterectomy may be possible. The reason as to why some bitches develop acromegaly and diabetes mellitus during the oestrous cycle is unknown.", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersomatotropism_(veterinary)"}

In cats with difficult to control diabetes mellitus, hypersomatotropism should be considered as a cause only after exclusion of other conditions that can impact insulin. Bitches with hypersomatotropism are usually presented 3–5 weeks after oestrus. It is not uncommon for owners to report symptoms relating to the diabetes mellitus as having occurred during the previous oestrous cycle, typically more mild and ending with anoestrus.\nMost abnormalities on common tests, such as complete blood count, urinalysis, and biochemistry profile, are due to the diabetes mellitus. Some cats with hypersomatotropism have hyperproteinaemia. One study found it to be the only parameter more frequent in cats with hypersomatotropism than cats with just diabetes mellitus.\nThe common steps of diagnosis in cats involve presentation with diabetes mellitus, on examination either the acromegalic effects are noticed or they are not noticed and hypersomatotropism is not suspected until efforts to control the diabetes are proving difficult. Following this levels of growth hormone or IGF-1 are measured, if the results suggest hypersomatotropism it is then usually followed up with CT/MRI imaging to find the pituitary mass. In dogs the tentative diagnosis is made based on signs of acromegaly or diabetes mellitus alongside progestogen administration or dioestrus.

However the cost may impact availability of this.\nAll cats with hypersomatotropism that have been tested in studies displayed increased growth hormone levels. Some cats had significantly increased levels; in other cats, the increase was only slightly above normal levels. Cats in those studies were likely in the later stages of the disease. A single instance of elevated growth hormone levels is not indicative of hypersomatotropism, it can be the result of a secretory pulse and mildly increased growth hormone levels have been observed in diabetic cats without hypersomatotropism. The recommended practice is for several tests with 10 minute intervals.\nIGF-1 levels can be detected with a blood test. The vast majority of cats with hypersomatotropism have increased IGF-1 levels, most dogs with hypersomatotropism have increased IGF-1 levels. Normal levels of IGF-1 have been seen in a few cats, potentially due to these cats being at the early stages of the disease. Other causes need to be investigated in cats with normal IGF-1 levels and suspected hypersomatotropism. IGF-1 levels may be lower due to lymphoma or other diseases. IGF-1 levels can be normal in cats with hypersomatotropism when the measurement is taken prior to insulin therapy. IGF-1 levels are significantly lower in cats with untreated diabetes mellitus without hypersomatotropism. To counteract this, diabetic cats with suspected hypersomatotropism can be treated for 6–8 weeks with insulin before testing. Another issue with IGF-1 testing is that most tests consider values of other 1000 ng/mL to be indicative of hypersomatotropism, even though healthy cats and cats with diabetes mellitus but not hypersomatotropism have levels below 800 ng/mL, leaving a grey zone of 800–1000 ng/mL. A study in 2000 reported eight cats with diabetes mellitus without hypersomatotropism had levels of IGF-1 above the normal range. Other studies suggested that this result was due to long term insulin therapy.

The adrenal glands secrete glucocorticoids such as cortisol and mineralocorticoids such as aldosterone; when proper amounts of these are not produced, the metabolic and electrolyte balance is upset. Mineralocorticoids control the amount of potassium, sodium, and water in the body. Hypoadrenocorticism is fatal if left untreated.\nThe most common cause of inadequate adrenal production is idiopathic adrenocortical atrophy. All causes for hypoadrenocorticism are not yet known. The usual causes are genetic, often related to autoimmune disorders, where the body attacks and kill its own tissue (\"immune mediated destruction\"). Other cases are caused by various disease processes, including failure of the pituitary gland to secrete ACTH, the hormone which stimulates the adrenal production of cortisol.\nHypoadrenocorticism is more frequent in dogs than in humans; in fact, it may occur one hundred times more often in the canine population. It mostly affects young to middle-aged female dogs, as the average age at diagnosis being four years old (although it has been found in puppies and dogs up to twelve years old). About seventy percent of dogs that are diagnosed with hypoadrenocorticism are female. Hypoadrenocorticism is still relatively uncommon or underdiagnosed in dogs. Statistics gathered from a large veterinary hospital placed the number at 0.36 dogs per 1000.

Elevated concentrations of potassium (hyperkalemia), and low sodium and chloride values (hyponatremia and hypochloremia) are the classic electrolyte alterations. The sodium/potassium ratio often is <27 (normal is between 27:1 and 40:1) and maybe <20 in animals with primary adrenal insufficiency. However, not all dogs have an abnormal electrolyte ratio during an Addisonian episode.\nECG - The severity of the ECG abnormalities correlates with the severity of the hyperkalemia. Therefore, the ECG can be used to identify and estimate the severity of hyperkalemia and to monitor changes in serum potassium during therapy.\nDiagnostic imaging - Abdominal ultrasound may reveal small adrenal glands, suggesting adrenocortical atrophy. However, finding normal-sized adrenal glands does not rule out hypoadrenocorticism. Rarely, megaesophagus is evident on radiographs.\nACTH stimulation test - Confirmation requires evaluation of an ACTH stimulation test. Baseline plasma cortisol and urine cortisol/Cr ratios are unreliable for confirming the diagnosis. One major diagnostic criterion is abnormally decreased post-ACTH plasma cortisol. Normal plasma cortisol after ACTH stimulation rules out adrenal insufficiency.

Differentiation between primary and secondary hypoadrenocorticism can be made by periodically measuring serum electrolytes, baseline endogenous ACTH, or possibly serum or plasma aldosterone during the ACTH stimulation test. While most corticosteroid drugs will invalidate the results of an ACTH test, dexamethasone may be used in the event of an Addison's emergency without fear of compromising the results of the test.\nIn general, hypoadrenocorticism is underdiagnosed in dogs, and one must have a clinical suspicion of it as an underlying disorder for many presenting complaints. Females are overrepresented (~70% of cases), and the disease often appears in middle age (four to seven years), although any age or gender may be affected.

Occasionally there may be swelling of the front part of the neck due to goiter. Untreated cases of hypothyroidism during pregnancy can lead to delays in growth and intellectual development in the baby or congenital iodine deficiency syndrome.\nWorldwide, too little iodine in the diet is the most common cause of hypothyroidism. Hashimoto's thyroiditis, an autoimmune disease where the body's immune system reacts to the thyroid gland, is the most common cause of hypothyroidism in countries with sufficient dietary iodine. Less common causes include previous treatment with radioactive iodine, injury to the hypothalamus or the anterior pituitary gland, certain medications, a lack of a functioning thyroid at birth, or previous thyroid surgery. The diagnosis of hypothyroidism, when suspected, can be confirmed with blood tests measuring thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroxine (T4) levels.\nSalt iodization has prevented hypothyroidism in many populations. Thyroid hormone replacement with levothyroxine treats hypothyroidism. Medical professionals adjust the dose according to symptoms and normalization of the TSH levels. Thyroid medication is safe in pregnancy. Although an adequate amount of dietary iodine is important, too much may worsen specific forms of hypothyroidism.\nWorldwide about one billion people are estimated to be iodine-deficient; however, it is unknown how often this results in hypothyroidism. In the United States, overt hypothyroidism occurs in approximately 0.3–0.4% of people. Subclinical hypothyroidism, a milder form of hypothyroidism characterized by normal thyroxine levels and an elevated TSH level, is thought to occur in 4.3–8.5% of people in the United States. Hypothyroidism is more common in women than in men. People over the age of 60 are more commonly affected. Dogs are also known to develop hypothyroidism, as are cats and horses, albeit more rarely.

Canine mastadenovirus A also causes disease in wolves, coyotes, and bears, and encephalitis in foxes.  The virus is spread in the feces, urine, blood, saliva, and nasal discharge of infected dogs.  It is contracted through the mouth or nose, where it replicates in the tonsils.  The virus then infects the liver and kidneys.  The incubation period is 4 to 9 days.\nSymptoms include fever, depression, loss of appetite, coughing, and a tender abdomen.  Corneal edema and signs of liver disease, such as jaundice, vomiting, and hepatic encephalopathy, may also occur.  Severe cases will develop bleeding disorders, which can cause hematomas to form in the mouth.  Death can occur secondary to this or the liver disease.  However, most dogs recover after a brief illness, although chronic corneal edema and kidney lesions may persist.\nDiagnosis is made by recognizing the combination of symptoms and abnormal blood tests that occur in infectious canine hepatitis.  A rising antibody titer to CAV-1 is also seen.  The disease can be confused with canine parvovirus because both will cause a low white blood cell count and bloody diarrhea in young, unvaccinated dogs.\nTreatment is symptomatic.  Most dogs recover spontaneously without treatment.  Prevention is through vaccination (ATCvet code QI07AA05 (WHO) and various combination vaccines).  Most combination vaccines for dogs contain a modified canine adenovirus type-2.  CAV-2 is one of the causes of respiratory infections in dogs, but it is similar enough to CAV-1 that vaccine for one creates immunity for both.

{"condition": "Inflammatory bowel disease", "species": "mixed", "section": "unlabelled", "paragraph_id": 22, "text": "Research\nThe following treatment strategies are not used routinely, but appear promising in some forms of IBD.\nInitial reports suggest that helminthic therapy may not only prevent but even control IBD: a drink with roughly 2,500 ova of the Trichuris suis helminth taken twice monthly decreased symptoms markedly in many patients. It is even speculated that an effective \"immunization\" procedure could be developed—by ingesting the cocktail at an early age.\nPrebiotics and probiotics are focusing increasing interest as treatments for IBD. Currently, there is evidence to support the use of certain probiotics in addition to standard treatments in people with ulcerative colitis but there is no sufficient data to recommend probiotics in people with Crohn's disease. Both single strain and multi-strain probiotics have been researched for mild to moderate cases of ulcerative colitis.  The most clinically researched multi-strain probiotic with over 70 human trials is the De Simone Formulation.  Further research is required to identify specific probiotic strains or their combinations and prebiotic substances for therapies of intestinal inflammation.\nCurrently, the probiotic strain, frequency, dose and duration of the probiotic therapy are not established. In severely ill people with IBD there is a risk of the passage of viable bacteria from the gastrointestinal tract to the internal organs (bacterial translocation) and subsequent bacteremia, which can cause serious adverse health consequences. Live bacteria might not be essential because of beneficial effects of probiotics seems to be mediated by their DNA and by secreted soluble factors, and their therapeutic effects may be obtained by systemic administration rather than oral administration.\nIn 2005 New Scientist published a joint study by Bristol University and the University of Bath on the apparent healing power of cannabis on IBD. Reports that cannabis eased IBD symptoms indicated the possible existence of cannabinoid receptors in the intestinal lining, which respond to molecules in the plant-derived chemicals. CB1 cannabinoid receptors – which are known to be present in the brain – exist in the endothelial cells which line the gut, it is thought that they are involved in repairing the lining of the gut when damaged.\nThe team deliberately damaged the cells to cause inflammation of the gut lining and then added synthetically produced cannabinoids; the result was that gut started to heal: the broken cells were repaired and brought back closer together to mend the tears. It is believed that in a healthy gut, natural endogenous cannabinoids are released from endothelial cells when they are injured, which then bind to the CB1 receptors. The process appears to set off a wound-healing reaction, and when people use cannabis, the cannabinoids bind to these receptors in the same way.\nPrevious studies have shown that CB1 receptors located on the nerve cells in the gut respond to cannabinoids by slowing gut motility, therefore reducing the painful muscle contractions associated with diarrhea. CB2, another cannabinoid receptor predominantly expressed by immune cells, was detected in the gut of people with IBD at a higher concentration. These receptors, which also respond to chemicals in cannabis, appear to be associated with apoptosis – programmed cell death – and may have a role in suppressing the overactive immune system and reducing inflammation by mopping up excess cells.\nActivation of the endocannabinoid system was found efficient in ameliorating colitis and increasing the survival rate of mice, and reducing remote organ changes induced by colitis, further suggest that modulation of this system is a potential therapeutic approach for IBDs and the associated remote organ lesions.\nAlicaforsen is a first generation antisense oligodeoxynucleotide designed to bind specifically to the human ICAM-1 messenger RNA through Watson-Crick base pair interactions in order to subdue expression of ICAM-1. ICAM-1 propagates an inflammatory response promoting the extravasation and activation of leukocytes (white blood cells) into inflamed tissue. Increased expression of ICAM-1 has been observed within the inflamed intestinal mucosa of people with ulcerative colitis, pouchitis and Crohn's, where ICAM-1 over production correlated with disease activity. This suggests that ICAM-1 is a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of these diseases.\nCannabinoid CB2 receptor agonists are found to decrease the induction of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 surface expression in human brain tissues and primary human brain endothelial cells (BMVEC) exposed to various pro-inflammatory mediators.\nIn 2014, an alliance among the Broad Institute, Amgen and Massachusetts General Hospital formed with the intention to \"collect and analyze patient DNA samples to identify and further validate genetic targets.\"\nIn 2015, a meta-analysis on 938 IBD patients and 953 controls, IBD was significantly associated with having higher odds of vitamin D deficiency.\nGram-positive bacteria present in the lumen could be associated with extending the time of relapse for ulcerative colitis.\nBidirectional pathways between depression and IBD have been suggested  and psychological processes have been demonstrated to influence self-perceived physical and psychological health over time. IBD-disease activity may impact quality of life and over time may significantly affect individual's mental well-being, which may be related to the increased risk to develop anxiety and/or depression. On the other hand, psychological distress may also influence IBD activity.\nHigher rates of anxiety and depression are observed among those with IBD compared to healthy individuals, which correlated with disease severity. Part of this phenotypic correlation is due to a shared genetic overlap between IBD and psychiatric comorbidities. Moreover, anxiety and depression rates increase during active disease compared with inactive phases.\nFlu vaccines are recommended for people with IBD in the UK; however, research suggests that vaccine uptake is low. Researchers analysed data on 13,631 adults with IBD on immune-suppressing drugs during the 2018 – 2019 flu season. Only half of this population received a vaccine during this period and few (32%) were vaccinated before the flu circulated in the community. This could be due to the belief that flu vaccines cause IBD flares; however, the same study did not find a link between vaccination and IBD flares.", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammatory_bowel_disease"}

For example, many dogs respond to only dietary changes compared to humans with IBD, who often need immunosuppressive treatment. Some dogs may also need immunosuppressant or antibiotic treatment when dietary changes are not enough. After having excluded other diseases that can lead to vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain in dogs, intestinal biopsies are often performed to investigate what kind of inflammation is occurring (lymphoplasmacytic, eosinophilic, or granulomatous).

{"condition": "Ketoconazole", "species": "mixed", "section": "unlabelled", "paragraph_id": 15, "text": "Antihormonal activity\nAs an antiandrogen, ketoconazole operates through at least two mechanisms of action. First, and most notably, high oral doses of ketoconazole (e.g. 400 mg three times per day) block both testicular and adrenal androgen biosynthesis, leading to a reduction in circulating testosterone levels. It produces this effect through inhibition of 17α-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase, which are involved in the synthesis and degradation of steroids, including the precursors of testosterone. Due to its efficacy at reducing systemic androgen levels, ketoconazole has been used with some success as a treatment for androgen-dependent prostate cancer. Second, ketoconazole is an androgen receptor antagonist, competing with androgens such as testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) for binding to the androgen receptor. This effect is thought to be quite weak however, even with high oral doses of ketoconazole.\nKetoconazole, along with miconazole, has been found to act as an antagonist of the glucocorticoid receptor.\nKetoconazole is a racemic mixture consisting of cis-(2S,4R)-(−) and cis-(2R,4S)-(+) enantiomers. The cis-(2S,4R) isomer was more potent in inhibiting progesterone 17α,20-lyase than its enantiomer (IC50 values of 0.05 and 2.38 μM, respectively) and in inhibiting 11β-hydroxylase (IC50 values of 0.152 and 0.608 μM, respectively). Both isomers were relatively weak inhibitors of human placental aromatase.\nOral ketoconazole has been used clinically as a steroidogenesis inhibitor in men, women, and children at dosages of 200 to 1,200 mg/day. Numerous small studies have investigated the effects of oral ketoconazole on hormone levels in humans. It  has been found in men to significantly decrease testosterone and estradiol levels and to significantly increase luteinizing hormone, progesterone, and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone levels, whereas levels of androstenedione, follicle-stimulating hormone, and prolactin were unaffected. The ratio of testosterone to estradiol is also decreased during oral ketoconazole therapy in men. Suppression of testosterone levels by ketoconazole is generally partial and has often been found to be transient. Better effects on suppression of testosterone levels have been observed in men when ketoconazole is combined with a GnRH agonist to suppress the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis, which prevents compensatory upregulation of luteinizing hormone secretion and consequent activation of gonadal testosterone production. In premenopausal women with polycystic ovary syndrome, ketoconazole has been found to significantly decrease levels of androstenedione and testosterone and significantly increase levels of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone and estradiol. Studies in postmenopausal women with breast cancer have found that ketoconazole significantly decreases androstenedione levels, slightly decreases estradiol levels, and does not affect estrone levels. This indicates minimal inhibition of aromatase by ketoconazole in vivo in humans. Ketoconazole has also been found to decrease levels of endogenous corticosteroids, such as cortisol, corticosterone, and aldosterone, as well as vitamin D.\nKetoconazole has been found to displace dihydrotestosterone and estradiol from sex hormone-binding globulin in vitro, but this was not found to be relevant in vivo.", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketoconazole"}

{"condition": "Laryngeal paralysis", "species": "mixed", "section": "unlabelled", "paragraph_id": 0, "text": "Laryngeal paralysis in animals is a condition in which the nerves and muscles that control the movements of one or both arytenoid cartilages of the larynx cease to function, and instead of opening during aspiration and closing during swallowing, the arytenoids remain stationary in a somewhat neutral position. Specifically, the muscle that causes abduction of the arytenoid cartilage, the cricoarytenoideus dorsalis muscle, ceases to function. This leads to inadequate ventilation during exercise and during thermoregulatory panting as well as incomplete protection of the airway during swallowing. \nOne of the most common forms of laryngeal paralysis develops in geriatric medium to large breed dogs, in particular the Labrador retriever, but also some other breeds. This had been traditionally known as idiopathic laryngeal  paralysis (\"ILP\": idiopathic means \"of unknown cause\"), and was believed to be a result of a condition affecting the nerves of the larynx (bilateral mononeuropathy of the recurrent laryngeal nerves). However investigations into ILP by two groups in Michigan and Tennessee between 2005 - 2013 showed that the condition was not limited to, or specifically a result of, dysfunction of the laryngeal nerves. Instead it was the most visible symptom of a slowly progressing polyneuropathy of old age, which also affected other nerves in the body.  This finding, now generally believed correct following further research, has led to the proposed renaming of this type of laryngeal paralysis from \"Idiopathic laryngeal paralysis\" (\"ILP\") to \"Geriatric onset laryngeal paralysis polyneuropathy\" (\"GOLPP\").\nAnimals affected by laryngeal paralysis have reduced tolerance for exercise and heat and an increased risk of aspiration pneumonia. The condition is not generally regarded as causing pain, other than physical distress and anxiety caused by any difficulty in breathing or emotional distress from any difficulty with physical movement.  Where laryngeal paralysis is related to a general progressive polyneuropathy, as in GOLPP, the nervous system will gradually degenerate causing increasing difficulty in management of the limbs (especially rear limbs), swallowing and breathing, and eventually in most cases euthanasia. Laryngeal paralysis is fairly common in large breed and geriatric dogs, particularly in the Labrador retriever, is rarely found in cats, and can also occur in horses where it is referred to as roaring, roarer's syndrome, or medically as laryngeal hemiplegia or  recurrent laryngeal neuropathy (RLN).

{"condition": "Laryngeal paralysis", "species": "mixed", "section": "unlabelled", "paragraph_id": 1, "text": "Causes\nIn most cases, the cause of laryngeal paralysis is unknown or idiopathic.  However, the disorder may arise secondary to general neuropathies, generalized neuromuscular diseases, muscular diseases, neoplasia either in the cervical (neck) region or the cranial mediastinum, or trauma. This acquired form occurs predominantly in middle-aged to old large breed or giant breed dogs such as the Labrador Retriever, golden retriever, Siberian Husky, Newfoundland, and St. Bernard.  Usually these dogs are born with a normal larynx, but over time the nerves and muscles that control the laryngeal cartilages lose function.\nLaryngeal paralysis may also be congenital in some breeds (e.g. Bouvier des Flandres, Dalmatians, Siberian huskies, and bulldogs), appearing in dogs between two and six months of age. Affected puppies may have difficulty swallowing and breathing, they may gag frequently, and their bark often sounds abnormal.  In Dalmatians it is part of another condition called 'laryngeal paralysis-polyneuropathy complex.'   Affected puppies should not be used for breeding.\nChoke collars are not thought to be a significant risk factor for this disorder. However, after LP is diagnosed it is usually recommended to stop using a collar or anything else around the dog's neck and to switch to a harness instead.\nThe University College Dublin researchers discovered genetic markers related to the recurrent Roarer Syndrome (RLN) which will lead to genetic testing development for identification of three-times higher risk horses.", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laryngeal_paralysis"}

Secondary problems may also occur, including aspiration or edema in the lungs, though often the problem remains an upper respiratory problem.  Affected dogs are vulnerable to heat stroke and heat exhaustion due to their limited ability to cool themselves down by panting, but the disorder itself can be mistaken for heat stroke.   \nSigns may occur at any time, but initially owners may only notice that their dog's bark sounds different, that their dog can't run as much as before, or that the dog has trouble in hot weather in unilateral cases because the unaffected side can compensate for the paralysed side.  However most unilateral cases will eventually progress to include both sides of the larynx, a more serious problem with symptoms appearing more often. \nSigns are usually worse in hot and humid weather, during exercise, during times of stress or excitement, and in obese pets.

Mild sedatives can be used to decrease anxiety and panting and therefore improve respiration. Corticosteroids may also be administered in acute cases to decrease inflammation and edema of the larynx. \nSevere acute symptoms, such as difficulty breathing, hyperthermia, or aspiration pneumonia, must be stabilized with sedatives and oxygen therapy and may require steroid or antibiotic medications. Sometimes a tracheotomy is required to allow delivery of oxygen. Once the patient is stabilized, surgical treatment may be beneficial especially when paralysis occurs in both arytenoid cartilages (bilateral paralysis). The surgery (aretynoid lateralization, or a \"laryngeal tieback\") consists of suturing one of the aretynoid cartilages in a maximally abducted (open) position. This reduces the signs associated with inadequate ventilation (such as exercise intolerance or overheating) but may exacerbate the risk of aspiration and consequent pneumonia.  Tying back only one of the arytenoid cartilages instead of both helps reduce the risk of aspiration.  Afterwards the dog will still sound hoarse, and will need to be managed in the same way as those with mild cases of LP. \nRecent studies have found that many dogs with laryngeal paralysis have decreased motility of their esophagus. Animals with a history of regurgitation or vomiting should be fully evaluated for esophageal or other gastrointestinal disorders. Dogs with megaesophagus or other conditions causing frequent vomiting or regurgitation are at high risk for aspiration pneumonia after laryngeal tie-back.

It is generally spread through the bite of phlebotomine sandflies, Phlebotomus and Lutzomyia, and occurs most frequently in the tropics and sub-tropics of Africa, Asia, the Americas, and southern Europe. The disease can present in three main ways: cutaneous, mucocutaneous, or visceral. The cutaneous form presents with skin ulcers, while the mucocutaneous form presents with ulcers of the skin, mouth, and nose. The visceral form starts with skin ulcers and later presents with fever, low red blood cell count, and enlarged spleen and liver.\nInfections in humans are caused by more than 20 species of Leishmania. Risk factors include poverty, malnutrition, deforestation, and urbanization. All three types can be diagnosed by seeing the parasites under microscopy. Additionally, visceral disease can be diagnosed by blood tests.\nLeishmaniasis can be partly prevented by sleeping under nets treated with insecticide. Other measures include spraying insecticides to kill sandflies and treating people with the disease early to prevent further spread. The treatment needed is determined by where the disease is acquired, the species of Leishmania, and the type of infection. Recent research in leishmaniasis treatment explores combination therapies, nanotechnology-based drugs, and immunotherapy. \nFor cutaneous disease, paromomycin, fluconazole, or pentamidine may be effective.\nAbout 4 to 12 million people are currently infected in some 98 countries. About 2 million new cases and between 20 and 50 thousand deaths occur each year. About 200 million people in Asia, Africa, South and Central America, and southern Europe live in areas where the disease is common.

Signs and symptoms can range from none to mild (headaches, muscle pains, and fevers) to severe (bleeding in the lungs or meningitis). Weil's disease ( VILES), the acute, severe form of leptospirosis, causes the infected individual to become jaundiced (skin and eyes become yellow), develop kidney failure, and bleed. Bleeding from the lungs associated with leptospirosis is known as severe pulmonary haemorrhage syndrome.\nMore than 10 genetic types of Leptospira cause disease in humans. Both wild and domestic animals can spread the disease, most commonly rodents. The bacteria are spread to humans through animal urine or feces, or water or soil contaminated with animal urine and feces, coming into contact with the eyes, mouth, or nose, or breaks in the skin. In developing countries, the disease occurs most commonly in pest control, farmers, and low-income people who live in areas with poor sanitation. In developed countries, it occurs during heavy downpours and is a risk to pest controllers, sewage workers, and those involved in outdoor activities in warm and wet areas. Diagnosis is typically by testing for antibodies against the bacteria or finding bacterial DNA in the blood.\nEfforts to prevent the disease include protective equipment to block contact when working with potentially infected animals, washing after contact, and reducing rodents in areas where people live and work. The antibiotic doxycycline is effective in preventing leptospirosis infection. Human vaccines are of limited usefulness; vaccines for other animals are more widely available. Treatment when infected is with antibiotics such as doxycycline, penicillin, or ceftriaxone. The overall risk of death is 5–10%, but when the lungs are involved, the risk of death increases to the range of 50–70%.\nAn estimated one million severe cases of leptospirosis in humans occur every year, causing about 58,900 deaths. The disease is most common in tropical areas of the world, but may occur anywhere. Outbreaks may arise after heavy rainfall. The disease was first described by physician Adolf Weil in 1886 in Germany. Infected animals may have no, mild, or severe symptoms. These may vary by the type of animal.

The illness is biphasic in a majority of symptomatic cases. Symptoms of the first phase (acute or leptospiremic phase) last five to seven days. In the second phase (immune phase), the symptoms resolve as antibodies against the bacteria are produced. Additional symptoms develop in the second phase. The phases of illness may not be distinct, especially in patients with severe illness. About 90% of those infected experience mild symptoms, while 10% experience severe leptospirosis.\nLeptospiral infection in humans causes a range of symptoms, though some infected persons may have none. The disease begins suddenly with fever accompanied by chills, intense headache, severe muscle aches, and abdominal pain. A headache brought on by leptospirosis causes throbbing pain and is characteristically located at the head's bilateral temporal or frontal regions. The person could also have pain behind the eyes and a sensitivity to light. Muscle pain usually involves the calf muscle and the lower back. The most characteristic feature of leptospirosis is the conjunctival suffusion (conjunctivitis without exudate), which is rarely found in other febrile illnesses. Other characteristic findings on the eye include subconjunctival bleeding and jaundice. A rash is rarely found in leptospirosis. When one is found, alternative diagnoses such as dengue fever and chikungunya fever should be considered. Dry cough is observed in 20–57% of people with leptospirosis. Thus, this clinical feature can mislead a doctor to diagnose the disease as a respiratory illness. Additionally, gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhoea frequently occur. Vomiting and diarrhea may contribute to dehydration. The abdominal pain can be due to acalculous cholecystitis or inflammation of the pancreas. Rarely, the lymph nodes, liver, and spleen may be enlarged and palpable.\nResolution of symptoms occurs for one to three days. The immune phase starts after this and can last from four to 30 days, and can vary from brain to kidney complications. The hallmark of the second phase is inflammation of the membranes covering the brain. Signs and symptoms of meningitis include severe headache and neck stiffness. Kidney involvement is associated with reduced or absent urine output.\nThe classic form of severe leptospirosis, known as Weil's disease, is characterised by liver damage (causing jaundice), kidney failure, and bleeding, which happens in 5–10% of those infected. Lung and brain damage can also occur. For those with signs of inflammation of membranes covering the brain and the brain itself, altered level of consciousness can happen. A variety of neurological problems such as paralysis of half of the body, complete inflammation of a whole horizontal section of spinal cord, and Guillain-Barré syndrome are the complications. Signs of bleeding such as petechiae, ecchymoses, nose bleeding, blackish stools due to bleeding in the stomach, vomiting blood, and bleeding from the lungs can also be found. Prolongation of prothrombin time in coagulation testing is associated with severe bleeding manifestations. However, low platelet count is not associated with severe bleeding. Pulmonary haemorrhage is alveolar haemorrhage (bleeding into the alveoli of the lungs) leading to massive coughing up of blood, and causing acute respiratory distress syndrome, where the risk of death is more than 50%. Rarely, inflammation of the heart muscles, inflammation of membranes covering the heart, abnormalities in the heart's natural pacemaker and abnormal heart rhythms may occur.", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leptospirosis"}
{"condition": "Leptospirosis", "species": "dog", "section": "unlabelled", "paragraph_id": 2, "text": "Cause\nBacteria\nLeptospirosis is caused by spirochaete bacteria that belong to the genus Leptospira, which are aerobic, right-handed helical, and 6–20 micrometers long. Like Gram-negative bacteria, Leptospira species have an outer membrane studded with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on the surface, an inner membrane, and a layer of peptidoglycan in the cell wall. However, unlike Gram-negative bacteria, the peptidoglycan layer in Leptospira lies closer to the inner than the outer membrane. This results in a fluid outer membrane loosely associated with the cell wall. In addition, Leptospira basteria have a flagellum located in the periplasm, associated with corkscrew-style movement. Chemoreceptors at the poles of the bacteria sense various substrates and change the direction of their movement. The bacteria are traditionally seen using dark-field microscopy without staining.\nIn total, 66 species of Leptospira have been identified. Based on their genomic sequence, they are divided into two clades and four subclades: P1, P2, S1, and S2. The 19 members of the P1 subclade include the eight species that can cause severe disease in humans: L. alexanderi, L. borgpetersenii, L. interrogans, L. kirschneri, L. mayottensis, L. noguchii, L. santarosai, and L. weilii. The P2 clade comprises 21 species that may cause mild disease in humans. The remaining 26 species comprise the S1 and S2 subclades, which include \"saprophytes\" known to consume decaying matter (saprotrophic nutrition). Pathogenic Leptospira species do not multiply in the environment. They require high humidity for survival, but can remain alive in environments such as stagnant water or contaminated soil. The bacteria can be killed by temperatures of 50 °C (122 °F) and can be inactivated by 70% ethanol, 1% sodium hypochlorite, formaldehyde, detergents, and acids.\nLeptospira species are also classified based on their serovar. The diverse sugar composition of the lipopolysaccharide on the surface of the bacteria is responsible for the antigenic difference between serovars. About 300 pathogenic serovars of Leptospira are recognised. Antigenically related serovars (belonging to the same serogroup) may belong to different species because of horizontal gene transfer of LPS biosynthetic genes between different species. Currently, the cross-agglutination absorption test and DNA–DNA hybridisation are used to classify Leptospira species, but are time-consuming. Therefore, total genomic sequencing could potentially replace these two methods as the new gold standard of classifying Leptospira species.", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leptospirosis"}
{"condition": "Leptospirosis", "species": "dog", "section": "unlabelled", "paragraph_id": 3, "text": "Transmission\nThe survival of Leptospira bacteria is influenced by environmental factors, with transmission dynamics affected by climate change, extreme weather events, urbanisation, and interactions between human and animal populations. The bacteria thrive in warm and humid climates due to their preference for environments that maintain high moisture content and optimal temperatures for metabolic activity and motility. The bacteria can be found in ponds, rivers, puddles, sewers, agricultural fields, and moist soil. Pathogenic Leptospira have been found in the form of aquatic biofilms, which may aid survival in the environment.\nThe number of cases of leptospirosis is directly related to the amount of rainfall, making the disease seasonal in temperate climates and year-round in tropical climates. The risk of contracting leptospirosis depends upon the risk of disease carriage in the community and the frequency of exposure. In rural areas, farming and animal husbandry are the major risk factors for contracting leptospirosis. Poor housing and inadequate sanitation also increase the risk of infection. In tropical and subtropical areas, the disease often becomes widespread after heavy rains or after flooding.\nLeptospira bacteria are found mostly in mammals, but cold-blooded animals such as frogs, snakes, turtles, and toads have been shown to have the infection. Whether reservoirs of human infection exist is unknown. Rats, mice, and moles are important primary hosts, but other mammals, including dogs, deer, rabbits, hedgehogs, cattle, sheep, swine, raccoons, opossums, and skunks can also carry the disease. In Africa, a number of wildlife hosts have been identified as carriers, including the banded mongoose, Egyptian fox, Rusa deer, and shrews. Various mechanisms are known whereby animals can infect each other. Dogs may lick the urine of an infected animal off the grass or soil, or drink from an infected puddle. House-bound domestic dogs have contracted leptospirosis, apparently from licking the urine of infected mice in the house. Leptospirosis can also be transmitted by the semen of infected animals. Bacteria can be consistently present in animal urine and may persist for years.\nHumans are the accidental host of Leptospira. Humans become infected through contact with water or moist soil that contains urine and feces from infected animals. The bacteria enter through cuts, abrasions, ingestion of contaminated food, or contact with mucous membrane of the body (e.g., mouth, nose, and eyes). Occupations at risk of contracting leptospirosis include farmers, fishermen, garbage collectors, and sewage workers. The disease is also related to adventure tourism and recreational activities. It is common among water-sports enthusiasts in specific areas, including triathlons, water rafting, canoeing, and swimming, as prolonged immersion in water promotes the entry of the bacteria. However, Leptospira species are unlikely to penetrate intact skin. The disease is not known to spread between humans, and bacterial dissemination in recovery period is extremely rare in humans. Once humans are infected, bacterial shedding from the kidneys usually persists for up to 60 days.\nRarely, leptospirosis can be transmitted through an organ transplant. Infection through the placenta during pregnancy is also possible. It can cause miscarriage and infection in infants. Leptospirosis transmission through eating raw meat of wildlife animals has also been reported (e.g. psychiatric patients with allotriophagy).", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leptospirosis"}
{"condition": "Leptospirosis", "species": "dog", "section": "unlabelled", "paragraph_id": 4, "text": "Pathogenesis\nWhen animals ingest the bacteria, they circulate in the bloodstream, then lodge themselves into the kidneys through the glomerular or peritubular capillaries. The bacteria then pass into the lumens of the renal tubules and colonise the brush border and proximal convoluted tubule. This causes the continuous shedding of bacteria in the urine without the animal experiencing significant ill effects. This relationship between the animal and the bacteria is known as a commensal relationship, and the animal is known as a reservoir host.\nHumans are the accidental host of Leptospira. The pathogenesis of leptospirosis remains poorly understood despite research efforts. The bacteria enter the human body through a breach in the skin or the mucous membrane, then into the bloodstream. The bacteria later attach to the endothelial cells of the blood vessels and extracellular matrix (a complex network of proteins and carbohydrates present between cells). The bacteria use their flagella to move between cell layers. They bind to cells such as fibroblasts, macrophages, endothelial cells, and kidney epithelial cells. They also bind to several human proteins such as complement proteins, thrombin, fibrinogen, and plasminogen using surface leptospiral immunoglobulin-like (Lig) proteins such as LigB and LipL32, whose genes are found in all pathogenic species.\nThrough the innate immune system, endothelial cells of the capillaries in the human body are activated by the presence of these bacteria. The endothelial cells produce cytokines and antimicrobial peptides against the bacteria. These products regulate the coagulation cascade and movements of white blood cells. Macrophages presented in humans are able to engulf Leptospira. However, Leptospira can reside and proliferate in the cytoplasmic matrix after being ingested by macrophages. Those with severe leptospirosis can experience a high level of cytokines such as interleukin 6, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and interleukin 10. The high level of cytokines causes sepsis-like symptoms, which are life-threatening instead of helping to fight against the infection. Those who have a high risk of sepsis during a leptospirosis infection are found to have the HLA-DQ6 genotype, possibly due to superantigen activation, which damages bodily organs.\nLeptospira LPS only activates toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) in monocytes in humans. The lipid A molecule of the bacteria is not recognised by human TLR4 receptors. Therefore, the lack of Leptospira recognition by TLR4 receptors probably contributes to the leptospirosis disease process in humans.\nAlthough various mechanisms in the human body fight against the bacteria, Leptospira is well adapted to such an inflammatory condition created by it. In the bloodstream, it can activate host plasminogen to become plasmin that breaks down extracellular matrix, degrades fibrin clots and complemental proteins (C3b and C5) to avoid opsonisation. It can also recruit complement regulators such as Factor H, C4b-binding protein, factor H-like binding protein, and vitronectin to prevent the activation of membrane attack complex on its surface. It also secretes proteases to degrade complement proteins such as C3. It can bind to thrombin, which decreases the fibrin formation. Reduced fibrin formation increases the risk of bleeding. Leptospira also secretes sphingomyelinase and haemolysin that target red blood cells.\nLeptospira spreads rapidly to all organs through the bloodstream. They mainly affect the liver. They invade spaces between hepatocytes, causing apoptosis. The damaged hepatocytes and hepatocyte intercellular junctions cause bile leakage into the bloodstream, causing elevated levels of bilirubin, resulting in jaundice. Congested liver sinusoids and perisinusoidal spaces have been reported. Meanwhile, in the lungs, petechiae or frank bleeding can be found at the alveolar septum and spaces between alveoli. Leptospira secretes toxins that cause mild to severe kidney failure or interstitial nephritis. The kidney failure can recover completely or lead to atrophy and fibrosis. Rarely, inflammation of the heart muscles, coronary arteries, and aorta are found.", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leptospirosis"}

When a low haemoglobin count is present together with a low white cell count and thrombocytopenia, bone marrow suppression should be considered. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein may also be elevated.\nThe kidneys are commonly involved in leptospirosis. Blood urea and creatinine levels will be elevated. Leptospirosis increases potassium excretion in urine, which leads to a low potassium level and a low sodium level in the blood. Urinalysis may reveal the presence of protein, white blood cells, and microscopic haematuria. Because the bacteria settle in the kidneys, urine cultures will be positive for leptospirosis starting after the second week of illness until 30 days of infection.\nFor those with liver involvement, transaminases and direct bilirubin are elevated in liver function tests. The Icterohaemorrhagiae serogroup is associated with jaundice and elevated bilirubin levels. Hemolytic anemia contributes to jaundice. A feature of leptospirosis is acute haemolytic anaemia and conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, especially in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. Abnormal serum amylase and lipase levels (associated with pancreatitis) are found in those who are admitted to hospital due to leptospirosis. Impaired kidney function with creatinine clearance less than 50 ml/min is associated with elevated pancreatic enzymes.\nFor those with severe headaches who show signs of meningitis, a lumbar puncture can be attempted. If infected, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination shows lymphocytic predominance with a cell count of about 500/mm3, protein between 50 and 100 mg/mL and normal glucose levels.

Typically, L. biflexa antigen is used to detect the IgM antibodies. This test can quickly determine the diagnosis and help in early treatment. However, the test specificity depends upon the type of antigen used and the presence of antibodies from previous infections. The presence of other diseases such as Epstein–Barr virus infection, viral hepatitis, and cytomegalovirus infection can cause false-positive results. Other rapid screening tests have been developed such as dipsticks, latex, and slide agglutination tests.\nThe microscopic agglutination test (MAT) is the reference test for the diagnosis of leptospirosis. MAT is a test where serial dilutions of patient sera are mixed with different serovars of Leptospira. The mixture is then examined under a dark field microscope to look for agglutination. The highest dilution where 50% agglutination occurs is the result. MAT titres of 1:100 to 1:800 are diagnostic of leptospirosis. A fourfold or greater rise in titre of two sera taken at symptoms' onset and three to 10 days of disease onset confirms the diagnosis. During the acute phase of the disease, MAT is not specific in detecting a serotype of Leptospira because of cross-reactivity between the serovars. In the convalescent phase, MAT is more specific in detecting the serovar types.

Rodent abatement efforts and flood mitigation projects can also help to prevent it. Proper use of personal protective equipment (PPE) by people who have a high risk of occupational exposure can prevent leptospirosis infections in most cases.\nThere is no human vaccine suitable for worldwide use. Only a few countries, such as Cuba, Japan, France, and China, have approved inactivated vaccines with limited protective effects. Side effects such as nausea, injection site redness and swelling have been reported after the vaccine was injected. Since the immunity induced by one Leptospiraserovar is only protective against that specific one, trivalent vaccines have been developed. They do not confer long-lasting immunity to humans or animals. Vaccines for other animals are more widely available. Vaccination of livestock and domestic animals, particularly dogs and cattle, is an effective measure in preventing both animal illness and zoonotic transmission to humans.\nDoxycycline is given once a week as a prophylaxis and is effective in reducing the rate of leptospirosis infections amongst high-risk individuals in flood-prone areas. In one study, it reduced the number of leptospirosis cases in military personnel undergoing exercises in the jungles. In another study, it reduced the number of symptomatic cases after exposure to leptospirosis under heavy rainfall in endemic areas.\nThe prevention of leptospirosis from environmental sources like contaminated waterways, soil, sewers, and agricultural fields is disinfection used by effective microorganisms, which is mixed with bokashi mudballs for the infected waterways & sewers.", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leptospirosis"}

Early initiation of antibiotics may prevent the progression to severe disease. Therefore, in resource-limited settings, antibiotics can be started once leptospirosis is suspected after history taking and examination.\nFor mild leptospirosis, antibiotic recommendations such as doxycycline, azithromycin, ampicillin, and amoxicillin were based solely on in vitro testing. In 2001, the WHO recommended oral doxycycline (2 mg/kg up to 100 mg every 12 hours) for five to seven days for those with mild leptospirosis. Tetracycline, ampicillin, and amoxicillin can also be used in such cases. However, in areas where both rickettsia and leptospirosis are endemic, azithromycin and doxycycline are the drugs of choice. Doxycycline is not used in cases where the patient suffers from liver damage as it has been linked to hepatotoxicity.\nBased on a 1988 study, intravenous (IV) benzylpenicillin (also known as penicillin G) is recommended for the treatment of severe leptospirosis. Intravenous benzylpenicillin (30 mg/kg up to 1.2 g every six hours) is used for five to seven days. Amoxicillin, ampicillin, and erythromycin may also be used for severe cases. Ceftriaxone (1 g IV every 24 hours for seven days) is also effective for severe leptospirosis. Cefotaxime (1 g IV every six hours for seven days) and doxycycline (200 mg initially followed by 100 mg IV every 12 hours for seven days) are equally effective as benzylpenicillin (1.5 million units IV every six hours for seven days). Therefore, there is no evidence on differences in death reduction when benzylpenicillin is compared with ceftriaxone or cefotaxime. Another study conducted in 2007 also showed no difference in efficacy between doxycycline (200 mg initially followed by 100 mg orally every 12 hours for seven days) or azithromycin (2 g on day one followed by 1 g daily for two more days) for suspected leptospirosis. There was no difference in the resolution of fever, and azithromycin is better tolerated than doxycycline.\nOutpatients are given doxycycline or azithromycin. Doxycycline can shorten the duration of leptospirosis by two days, improve symptoms, and prevent the shedding of organisms in their urine. Azithromycin and amoxicillin are given to pregnant women and children. Rarely, a Jarisch–Herxheimer reaction can develop in the first few hours after antibiotic administration. However, according to a meta-analysis done in 2012, the benefit of antibiotics in the treatment of leptospirosis was unclear, although the use of antibiotics may reduce the duration of illness by two to four days. Another meta-analysis done in 2013 reached a similar conclusion.\nFor those with severe leptospirosis, including potassium wasting with high kidney output dysfunction, intravenous hydration and potassium supplements can prevent dehydration and hypokalemia. When acute kidney failure occurs, early initiation of haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis can help to improve survival. For those with respiratory failure, tracheal intubation with low tidal volume improves survival rates.\nCorticosteroids have been proposed to suppress inflammation in leptospirosis because Leptospira infection can induce the release of chemical signals which promote inflammation of blood vessels in the lungs.

Severe cases account for 5–15% of all leptospirosis cases. Leptospirosis is found in both urban and rural areas in tropical, subtropical, and temperate regions. The global health burden for leptospirosis can be measured by disability-adjusted life year (DALY). The score is 42 per 100,000 people per year, which is more than other diseases such as rabies and filariasis.\nThe convergence of climate change impacts—such as rising temperatures, flooding and natural disasters, mass migration, poverty, and public health challenges—with insufficient health and sanitation infrastructure heightens the risk of leptospirosis. Urban poor populations in densely populated cities are at particularly high risk due to limited access to sanitation and exposure to contaminated floodwaters. In countries such as Brazil, India, and the Philippines, outbreaks often follow heavy rainfall and flooding events.\nLeptospirosis is considered a neglected tropical disease (NTD), and its incidence may be significantly underreported due to diagnostic challenges and low awareness among healthcare providers.\nThe disease is observed persistently in parts of Asia, Oceania, the Caribbean, Latin America and Africa. Antarctica is the only place not affected by leptospirosis. In the United States, there were 100 to 150 leptospirosis cases annually. In 1994, leptospirosis ceased to be a notifiable disease in the United States except in 36 states/territories where it is prevalent such as Hawaii, Texas, California, and Puerto Rico. About 50% of the reported cases occurred in Puerto Rico. In January 2013, leptospirosis was reinstated as a nationally notifiable disease in the United States. Research on epidemiology of leptospirosis in high-risk groups and risk factors is limited in India.\nThe global rates of leptospirosis have been underestimated because most affected countries lack notification, or notification is not mandatory. Distinguishing clinical signs of leptospirosis from other diseases and lack of laboratory diagnostic services are other problems. The socioeconomic status of many of the world's population is closely tied to malnutrition; subsequent lack of micronutrients may lead to increased risk of infection and death due to leptospirosis infection.

{"condition": "Leptospirosis", "species": "dog", "section": "unlabelled", "paragraph_id": 14, "text": "History\nThe disease was first described by Adolf Weil in 1886 when he reported an \"acute infectious disease with enlargement of spleen, jaundice, and nephritis.\" Before Weil's description, the disease was known as \"rice field jaundice\" in ancient Chinese text, \"autumn fever\", \"seven-day fever\", and \"nanukayami fever\" in Japan; in Europe and Australia, the disease was associated with certain occupations and given names such as \"cane-cutter's disease\", \"swine-herd's disease\", and \"Schlammfieber\" (mud fever). It has been known historically as \"black jaundice\", or \"dairy farm fever\" in New Zealand. Leptospirosis was postulated as the cause of an epidemic among Native Americans along the coast of what is now New England during 1616–1619. The disease was most likely brought to the New World by Europeans.\nLeptospira was first observed in 1907 in a post mortem kidney tissue slice by Arthur Stimson using silver deposition staining technique. He called the organism Spirocheta interrogans because the bacteria resembled a question mark. In 1908, a Japanese research group led by Ryukichi Inada and Yutaka Ito first identified this bacterium as the causative agent of leptospirosis and noted its presence in rats in 1916. Japanese coal mine workers frequently contracted leptospirosis. In Japan, the organism was named Spirocheta icterohaemorrhagiae. The Japanese group also experimented with the first leptospiral immunisation studies in guinea pigs. They demonstrated that by injecting the infected guinea pigs with sera from convalescent humans or goats, passive immunity could be provided to the guinea pigs. In 1917, the Japanese group discovered rats as the carriers of leptospirosis. Unaware of the Japanese group's work, two German groups independently and almost simultaneously published their first demonstration of transmitting leptospiral infection in guinea pigs in October 1915. They named the organism Spirochaeta nodosa and Spirochaeta Icterogenes respectively. In 1917, Hideyo Noguchi conducted a study to find whether if the jaundice, specifically in the context of Weil's disease, which often spreads through the urine of the infected rats, is found in the bodies of American rats as it does in European and Japanese rats. During his research, he later  suggested the name of the new genus Leptospira meaning slim spiral that it falls under.\nLeptospirosis was subsequently recognised as a disease of all mammalian species. In 1933, Dutch workers reported the isolation of Leptospira canicola, which specifically infects dogs. In 1940, the strain that specifically infects cattle was first reported in Russia. In 1942, soldiers at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, were recorded to have an infectious disease which caused a rash over their shinbones. This disease was later known to be caused by leptospirosis. By the 1950s, the number of serovars that infected various mammals had expanded significantly. In the 1980s, leptospirosis was recognised as a veterinary disease of major economic importance.\nIn 1982, there were about 200 serovars of Leptospira available for classification. The International Committee on Systematic Bacteriology's subcommittee on taxonomy of Leptospira proposed classifying these serovars into two big groups: L. interrogans containing pathogenic serovars and L. biflexa containing saprophytic serovars. In 1979, the leptospiral family of Leptospiraceae was proposed. In the same year, Leptospira illini was reclassified as the new genus Leptonema. In 2002, \"Lepthangamushi syndrome\" was coined to describe a series of overlapping symptoms of leptospirosis with Hantavirus hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, and scrub typhus caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi. In 2005, Leptospira parva was classified as Turneriella. With DNA–DNA hybridisation technology, L. interrogans was divided into seven species. More Leptospira species have been discovered since then. The WHO established the Leptospirosis Burden Epidemiology Reference Group (LERG) to review the latest disease epidemiological data of leptospirosis, formulate a disease transmission model, and identify gaps in knowledge and research. The first meeting was convened in 2009. In 2011, LERG estimated that the global yearly rate of leptospirosis is five to 14 cases per 100,000 population.", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leptospirosis"}

In some animals, the bacteria live in the reproductive tract, leading to transmission during mating.\nAnimals also present with similar clinical features when compared to humans. Clinical signs can appear in 5–15 days in dogs. The incubation period can be prolonged in cats. Leptospirosis can cause abortions after 2–12 weeks in cattle, and 1–4 weeks of infection in pigs. The illness tends to be milder in reservoir hosts. The most commonly affected organs are the kidneys, liver, and reproductive system, but other organs can be affected. In dogs, the acute clinical signs include fever, loss of appetite, shivering, muscle pain, weakness, and urinary symptoms. Vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain may also be present. Petechiae and ecchymoses may be seen on mucous membranes. Bleeding from the lungs may also be seen in dogs. In chronic presentations, the affected dog may have no symptoms. In animals that have died of leptospirosis, their kidneys may be swollen with grey and white spots, mottling, or scarring. Their liver may be enlarged with areas of cell death. Petechiae and ecchymoses may be found in various organs. Inflammation of the blood vessels, inflammation of the heart, meningeal layers covering the brain and spinal cord, and uveitis are also possible. Equine recurrent uveitis (ERU) is the most common disease associated with Leptospira infection in horses in North America and may lead to blindness. ERU is an autoimmune disease involving antibodies against Leptospira proteins LruA and LruB cross-reacting with eye proteins. Live Leptospira can be recovered from the aqueous or vitreous fluid of many horses with Leptospira-associated ERU. Risk of death or disability in infected animals varies depending upon the species and age of the animals. In adult pigs and cattle, reproductive signs are the most common signs of leptospirosis. Up to 40% of cows may have a spontaneous abortion. Younger animals usually develop more severe disease. About 80% of dogs can survive with treatment, but the survival rate is reduced if the lungs are involved.\nELISA and microscopic agglutination tests are most commonly used to diagnose leptospirosis in animals. The bacteria can be detected in blood, urine, and milk or liver, kidney, or other tissue samples by using immunofluorescence or immunohistochemical or polymerase chain reaction techniques. Silver staining or immunogold silver staining is used to detect Leptospira in tissue sections. The organisms stain poorly with Gram stain. Dark-field microscopy can be used to detect Leptospira in body fluids, but it is neither sensitive nor specific in detecting the organism. A positive culture for leptospirosis is definitive, but the availability is limited, and culture results can take 13–26 weeks for a result, limiting its utility. Paired acute and convalescent samples are preferred for serological diagnosis of leptospirosis in animals. A positive serological sample from an aborted fetus is also diagnostic of leptospirosis.\nVarious antibiotics such as doxycycline, penicillins, dihydrostreptomycin, and streptomycin have been used to treat leptospirosis in animals. Fluid therapy, blood transfusion, and respiratory support may be required in severe disease. For horses with ERU, the primary treatment is with anti-inflammatory drugs.\nLeptospirosis vaccines are available for animals such as pigs, dogs, cattle, sheep, and goats. Vaccines for cattle usually contain Leptospira serovar Hardjo and Pomona, for dogs, the vaccines usually contain serovar Icterohaemorrhagiae and Canicola. Vaccines containing multiple serovars do not work for cattle as well as vaccines containing a single serovar, yet the multivalent vaccines continue to be sold. Isolation of infected animals and prophylactic antibiotics are also effective in preventing leptospirosis transmission between animals. Environmental control and sanitation also reduce transmission rates.", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leptospirosis"}

It is the most common disease spread by ticks in the Northern Hemisphere. Infections are most common in the spring and early summer.  \nThe most common sign of infection is an expanding red rash, known as erythema migrans (EM), which appears at the site of the tick bite about a week afterwards. The rash is typically neither itchy nor painful. Approximately 70–80% of infected people develop a rash. Other early symptoms may include fever, headaches and tiredness. If untreated, symptoms may include loss of the ability to move one or both sides of the face, joint pains, severe headaches with neck stiffness or heart palpitations. Months to years later, repeated episodes of joint pain and swelling may occur. Occasionally, shooting pains or tingling in the arms and legs may develop.\nDiagnosis is based on a combination of symptoms, history of tick exposure, and possibly testing for specific antibodies in the blood. If an infection develops, several antibiotics are effective, including doxycycline, amoxicillin and cefuroxime. Standard treatment usually lasts for two or three weeks. People with persistent symptoms after appropriate treatments are said to have Post-Treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome (PTLDS).\nPrevention includes efforts to prevent tick bites by wearing clothing to cover the arms and legs and using DEET or picaridin-based insect repellents. As of 2023, clinical trials of proposed human vaccines for Lyme disease were being carried out, but no vaccine was available.

Provisional figures for the first 3 quarters of 2011 show a 26% increase on the same period in 2010.\nIt is thought, however, that the actual number of cases is significantly higher than suggested by the above figures, with England's Health Protection Agency estimating that there are between 2,000 and 3,000 cases in England and Wales per year (with an average of around 15% of the infections acquired overseas), while Dr Darrel Ho-Yen, Director of the Scottish Toxoplasma Reference Laboratory and National Lyme Disease Testing Service, believes that the number of confirmed cases should be multiplied by 10 \"to take account of wrongly diagnosed cases, tests giving false results, sufferers who weren't tested, people who are infected but not showing symptoms, failures to notify and infected individuals who don't consult a doctor.\"\nLyme disease is a notifiable disease in Scotland.

{"condition": "Lyme disease", "species": "mixed", "section": "unlabelled", "paragraph_id": 39, "text": "Prevention\nTick bites can be prevented by avoiding or reducing time in likely tick habitats and taking precautions while in and when getting out of one.\nMost Lyme human infections are caused by Ixodes nymph bites between April and September. Ticks prefer moist, shaded locations in woodlands, shrubs, tall grasses and leaf litter or wood piles. Tick densities tend to be highest in woodlands, followed by unmaintained edges between woods and lawns (about half as high), ornamental plants and perennial groundcover (about a quarter), and lawns (about 30 times less). Ixodes larvae and nymphs tend to be abundant also where mice nest, such as stone walls and wood logs. Ixodes larvae and nymphs typically wait for potential hosts (\"quest\") on leaves or grasses close to the ground with forelegs outstretched; when a host brushes against its limbs, the tick rapidly clings and climbs on the host looking for a skin location to bite. In Northeastern United States, 69% of tick bites are estimated to happen in residences, 11% in schools or camps, 9% in parks or recreational areas, 4% at work, 3% while hunting, and 4% in other areas. Activities associated with tick bites around residences include yard work, brush clearing, gardening, playing in the yard, and letting dogs or cats that roam outside in woody or grassy areas into the house. In parks, tick bites often happen while hiking or camping. Walking on a mown lawn or center of a trail without touching adjacent vegetation is less risky than crawling or sitting on a log or stone wall. Pets should not be allowed to roam freely in likely tick habitats.\nAs a precaution, CDC recommends soaking or spraying clothes, shoes, and camping gear such as tents, backpacks and sleeping bags with 0.5% permethrin solution and hanging them to dry before use. Permethrin is odorless and safe for humans but highly toxic to ticks. After crawling on permethrin-treated fabric for as few as 10–20 seconds, tick nymphs become irritated and fall off or die. Permethrin-treated closed-toed shoes and socks reduce by 74 times the number of bites from nymphs that make first contact with a shoe of a person also wearing treated shorts (because nymphs usually quest near the ground, this is a typical contact scenario). Better protection can be achieved by tucking permethrin-treated trousers (pants) into treated socks and a treated long-sleeve shirt into the trousers so as to minimize gaps through which a tick might reach the wearer's skin. Light-colored clothing may make it easier to see ticks and remove them before they bite. Military and outdoor workers' uniforms treated with permethrin have been found to reduce the number of bite cases by 80–95%. Permethrin protection lasts several weeks of wear and washings in customer-treated items and up to 70 washings for factory-treated items. Permethrin should not be used on human skin, underwear or cats.\nThe EPA recommends several tick repellents for use on exposed skin, including DEET, picaridin, IR3535 (a derivative of amino acid beta-alanine), oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE, a natural compound) and OLE's active ingredient para-menthane-diol (PMD). Unlike permethrin, repellents repel but do not kill ticks, protect for only several hours after application, and may be washed off by sweat or water. The most popular repellent is DEET in the U.S. and picaridin in Europe. Unlike DEET, picaridin is odorless and is less likely to irritate the skin or harm fabric or plastics. Repellents with higher concentration may last longer but are not more effective; against ticks, 20% picaridin may work for 8 hours vs. 55–98.11% DEET for 5–6 hours or 30–40% OLE for 6 hours. Repellents should not be used under clothes, on eyes, mouth, wounds or cuts, or on babies younger than 2 months (3 years for OLE or PMD). If sunscreen is used, repellent should be applied on top of it. Repellents should not be sprayed directly on a face, but should instead be sprayed on a hand and then rubbed on the face.\nAfter coming indoors, clothes, gear and pets should be checked for ticks. Clothes can be put into a hot dryer for 10 minutes to kill ticks (just washing or a warm dryer is not enough). Showering as soon as possible, looking for ticks over the entire body, and removing them reduces the risk of infection. Unfed tick nymphs are the size of a poppy seed, but a day or two after biting and attaching themselves to a person, they look like a small blood blister. The following areas should be checked especially carefully: armpits, between legs, back of knee, bellybutton, trunk, and in children ears, neck and hair.", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyme_disease"}
{"condition": "Lyme disease", "species": "mixed", "section": "unlabelled", "paragraph_id": 44, "text": "Host animals\nTicks can feed upon the blood of a wide array of possible host species, including lizards, birds, mice, cats, dogs, deer, cattle and humans. The extent to which a tick can feed, reproduce, and spread will depend on the type and availability of its hosts. Whether it will spread disease is also affected by its available hosts. Some species, such as lizards, are referred to as \"dilution hosts\" because they don't tend to support Lyme disease pathogens and decrease the likelihood that the disease will be passed on by ticks feeding on them. White-tailed deer are both a food source and a \"reproductive host\", where ticks tend to mate. The white-footed mouse  is a reservoir host in which the pathogen for Lyme disease can survive. The availability of hosts can have significant impacts on the transmission of Lyme disease. A greater diversity of hosts, or of those that don't support the pathogen, tends to decrease the likelihood that the disease will be transmitted.\nIn the United States, one approach to reducing the incidence of Lyme and other deer tick-borne diseases has been to greatly reduce the deer population on which the adult ticks depend for feeding and reproduction. Lyme disease cases fell following deer eradication on an island, Monhegan, Maine, and following deer control in Mumford Cove, Connecticut.  Advocates have suggested reducing the deer population to levels of 8 to 10 deer per square mile, compared to levels of 60 or more deer per square mile in the areas of the country with the highest Lyme disease rates. While these studies have found these effects, other studies have found opposite effects. A study done in Massachusetts removed deer and did not see a significant decrease in tick abundance afterwards. Another study done in New Jersey removed deer and also did not see a reduction in the number of questing ticks and determined that deer culling is an unlikely way to control tick populations effectively. One study summarized the results of multiple studies all looking at deer reduction controlling tick populations and determined that deer control can't be used as a standalone reduction for Lyme disease. It also claims that most studies examining this are not representative of areas with high human Lyme disease risk. There is varying information on whether or not the removal of deer is actually a way to control the Lyme disease epidemic. Removal of smaller mammals that are fed on by juveniles who are more actively acquiring and spreading the pathogen would decrease Lyme disease risk the most.\nOthers have noted that while deer are reproductive hosts, they are not Borrelia burgdorferi reservoirs. This is because it was found that white-tailed deer blood actually kills the Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria. Researchers have suggested that smaller, less obviously visible Lyme reservoirs, like white-footed mice and Eastern chipmunks, may more strongly impact Lyme disease occurrence. Ecosystem studies in New York state suggest that white-footed mice thrive when forests are broken into smaller, isolated chunks of woodland with fewer rodent predators. With more rodents harboring the disease, the odds increase that a tick will feed on a disease-harboring rodent and that someone will pick up a disease-carrying tick in their garden or while walking in the woods. Data indicates that the smaller the wooded area, the more ticks it will contain and the likely they are to carry Lyme disease, supporting the idea that  deforestation and habitat fragmentation affect ticks, hosts and disease transmission.\nTick-borne diseases are estimated to affect ~80 % of cattle worldwide. They also affect cats, dogs, and other pets. Routine veterinary control of ticks of domestic animals through the use of acaricides has been suggested as a way to reduce exposure of humans to ticks. However, chemical control with acaricides is now criticized on several grounds.  Ticks appear to develop resistance to acaricides; acaricides are costly; and there are concerns over their toxicity and the potential for chemical residues to affect food and the environment.\nIn Europe, known reservoirs of Borrelia burgdorferi were 9 small mammals, 7 medium-sized mammals and 16 species of birds (including passerines, sea-birds and pheasants). These animals seem to transmit spirochetes to ticks and thus participate in the natural circulation of B. burgdorferi in Europe. The house mouse is also suspected as well as other species of small rodents, particularly in Eastern Europe and Russia. \"The reservoir species that contain the most pathogens are the European roe deer Capreolus capreolus; \"it does not appear to serve as a major reservoir of B. burgdorferi\" thought Jaenson & al. (1992) (incompetent host for B. burgdorferi and TBE virus) but it is important for feeding the ticks, as red deer and wild boars (Sus scrofa), in which one Rickettsia and three Borrelia species were identified\", with high risks of coinfection in roe deer. Nevertheless, in the 2000s, in roe deer in Europe \"two species of Rickettsia and two species of Borrelia were identified\".", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyme_disease"}

Mediastinal lymphoma can cause fluid to collect around the lungs, leading to coughing and difficulty breathing. Hypercalcemia is most commonly associated with this type.\nGastrointestinal lymphoma causes vomiting, diarrhea, and melena (digested blood in the stool).  Low serum albumin levels and hypercalcemia can also occur.\nLymphoma of the skin is an uncommon occurrence.  The epitheliotropic form typically appears as itchy inflammation of the skin progressing to nodules and plaques.\nThe non-epitheliotropic form can have a wide variety of appearances, from a single lump to large areas of bruised, ulcerated, hairless skin.

The same is true for dogs that have entered remission and ceased treatment. Monitoring for disease and remission/recurrence is usually performed by palpation of peripheral lymph nodes. This procedure detects gross changes in peripheral lymph nodes. Some of the blood tests used in diagnosing lymphoma also offer greater objectivity and provide an earlier warning of an animal coming out of remission.\nComplete cure is rare with lymphoma and treatment tends to be palliative, but long remission times are possible with chemotherapy.  With effective protocols, average first remission times are 6 to 8 months.  Second remissions are shorter and harder to accomplish.  Average survival is 9 to 12 months.  The most common treatment is a combination of cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone, L-asparaginase, and doxorubicin.  Other chemotherapy drugs such as chlorambucil, lomustine (CCNU), cytosine arabinoside, and mitoxantrone are sometimes used in the treatment of lymphoma by themselves or in substitution for other drugs.

Whereas dogs often appear healthy initially except for swollen lymph nodes, cats will often be physically ill. The symptoms correspond closely to the location of the lymphoma.  The most common sites for alimentary (gastrointestinal) lymphoma are, in decreasing frequency, the small intestine, the stomach, the junction of the ileum, cecum, and colon.  Cats with the alimentary form of lymphoma often present with weight loss, rough hair coat, loss of appetite, vomiting and diarrhea, although vomiting and diarrhea are commonly absent as symptoms.  The tumor can also cause life-threatening blockage of the intestine.  Cats with the mediastinal form often have respiratory distress and fluid in the thoracic cavity. If lymphoma develops in the kidney, the cat may have increased water consumption and increased urination. Lymphoma of the kidney presents as bilateral kidney enlargement and failure. If the lymphoma is located in the nose, the cat may have discharge from the nose and facial swelling. Lymphoma of the heart causes congestive heart failure, pericardial effusion, and cardiac arrhythmias.  Ocular lymphoma in cats often presents as anterior uveitis (inflammation of the inside of the eye).  Cats who are also infected with FeLV often present with pale mucous membranes due to anemia. Anemia is a common problem in all cats with lymphoma, but hypercalcemia is rare.\nDiagnosis is similar to dogs, except cats should be tested for FeLV and FIV.  It is important to differentiate the alimentary form of lymphoma from inflammatory bowel disease because the signs are so similar in cats.  A biopsy is necessary to do this. One approach to differentiate inflammatory bowel disease is to test the infiltrating lymphocytes for their monoclonal origin in lymphomas.", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma_in_animals"}

Most of the drugs used in dogs are used in cats, but the most common protocol uses cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisolone. Gastrointestinal lymphoma has also commonly been treated with a combination of prednisolone and high dose pulse chlorambucil with success. The white blood cell count must be monitored. Remission and survival times are comparable to dogs. Lower stage lymphoma has a better prognosis. Multicentric lymphoma has a better response to treatment than the gastrointestinal form, but infection with FeLV worsens the prognosis.\nAbout 75% of cats treated with chemotherapy for lymphoma go into remission. Unfortunately, after an initial remission, most cats experience a relapse, after which they have a median survival of 6 months. However, about one-third of cats treated with chemotherapy will survive more than 2 years after diagnosis; a small number of these cats may be cured of their disease. Untreated, most cats with lymphoma die within 4–6 weeks. Most cats tolerate their chemotherapy well, and fewer than 5% have severe side effects. Cats do not lose their fur from chemotherapy, though loss of whiskers is possible. Other side effects include low white blood cell count, vomiting, loss of appetite, diarrhea, or fatigue. These can typically be controlled well, and most cats have a good quality of life during treatment. If a cat relapses after attaining remission, the cat can be treated with different chemotherapy drugs to try for a second remission. The chances of a second remission are much lower than the chances of obtaining a first, and the second remission is often shorter than the first.", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma_in_animals"}

The mammary glands in dogs and cats are associated with their nipples and extend from the underside of the chest to the groin on both sides of the midline. There are many differences between mammary tumors in animals and breast cancer in humans, including tumor type, malignancy, and treatment options. The prevalence in dogs is about three times that of women. In dogs, mammary tumors are the second most common tumor (after skin tumors) over all and the most common tumor in female dogs with a reported incidence of 3.4%. Multiple studies have documented that spaying female dogs when young greatly decreases their risk of developing mammary neoplasia when aged. Compared with female dogs left intact, those spayed before puberty have 0.5% of the risk, those spayed after one estrous cycle have 8.0% of the risk, and dogs spayed after two estrous cycles have 26.0% of the risk of developing mammary neoplasia later in life. Overall, unspayed female dogs have a seven times greater risk of developing mammary neoplasia than do those that are spayed. While the benefit of spaying decreases with each estrous cycle, some benefit has been demonstrated in female dogs even up to 9 years of age.

Adenomas and fibroadenomas make up the benign types. Malignant mammary tumors are divided into sarcomas, carcinosarcomas, inflammatory carcinomas (usually anaplastic carcinomas), and carcinomas (including adenocarcinomas), which are the most common. Inflammatory carcinomas describe tumors that are fast growing and have bruising, edema, and pain, and can also cause disseminated intravascular coagulation. They are the most malignant type of canine mammary tumor.\nMalignant tumors are also subdivided histopathologically into those showing blood vessel wall invasion and those that do not. Without blood vessel wall invasion there is a better prognosis. Dogs with noninvasive adenocarcinomas have an average survival time of two years, while dogs with invasive adenocarcinomas have an average survival time of one year. Tumor size also affects the prognosis, in that dogs with tumors greater than five centimeters have a greater chance of lymph node metastasis. Tumor type is also important. Sarcomas and carcinosarcomas carry an average survival time of nine to twelve months. Inflammatory carcinomas have a very poor prognosis, and have usually metastasized by the time of diagnosis. Metastasis for any malignant mammary tumor is usually to the regional lymph nodes and lungs.\nThe molecular carcinogenesis of canine mammary tumors are not completely understood. However, the increasing information on molecular pathways involved in the carcinogenesis of this canine tumor has potential to complement and refine the current diagnostic and therapeutic approach to this tumor type.

They carried first-aid supplies that could then be used by wounded soldiers, and comforted dying soldiers who were mortally wounded. They were also trained to guide combat medics to soldiers who required extensive care. Many mercy dogs were trained by national Red Cross societies to serve the country in which the specific society operated. The German army called such dogs medical dogs.

They were trained by the Red Cross society that was based in the country of each army to travel silently around no man's land, typically at night or after a battle had ended, looking for its side's wounded soldiers and ignoring dead or wounded enemy ones. When they found a soldier, the soldier could use the medical supplies to tend to their wounds. If their condition was severe enough that this was impossible, the dog would return to the trenches with a piece of the soldier's uniform and lead a paramedic to the soldier. If the dog was unsuccessful in finding a wounded soldier, it would lie down in front of its handler instead of leading the handler to them. Some dogs were fitted with gas masks.\nDogs attached to Allied Powers were trained to take a piece of uniform and those with the Central Powers any item, including a helmet or particularly a belt. Some dogs were also involved in pulling soldiers on carts between the front lines and medical bases further back. Mercy dogs were known to drag soldiers to safety at times. The dogs would also comfort mortally wounded soldiers as they died.\nA military surgeon praised the dog's abilities to triage wounded soldiers, saying \"They sometimes lead us to the bodies we think have no life in them, but when we bring them back to the doctors [. . .] they always find a spark. It is purely a matter of their instinct, [which] is far more effective than man's reasoning powers.\"", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercy_dog"}

The German army called them 'Sanitätshunde', or 'medical dogs'. The nation is estimated to have used a total of 30,000 dogs during the war, mainly as messengers and ambulance dogs. Of those, 7,000 were killed.  It is estimated that upwards of 50,000 dogs were used by all the combatants.\nUpon the outbreak of fighting, Britain did not have a program for training military dogs. Edwin Hautenville Richardson, an officer in the British Army who had experience working with military dogs and had advocated for the start of a military program since 1910, trained several dogs as ambulance dogs and offered them to the British Army. After the army did not accept, he gave them to the British Red Cross. As a result of his advocacy, Britain created a British War Dog School with Richardson as the commander. The school eventually trained more than 200 dogs.\nAs many as 10,000 dogs are estimated to have served as mercy dogs in World War I, and are credited with saving thousands of lives, including at least 2,000 in France and 4,000 wounded German soldiers. Several such dogs drew specific attention for their work, including Captain for finding 30 soldiers in one day, and Prusco for finding 100 men in just one battle. Both were French dogs. Prusco was known to drag soldiers into ditches as a safe harbor while he went to summon rescuers. However, many French dogs were killed in the line of action, and the program was discontinued.\nWhile many European nations had a mercy dog program during World War I, the United States did not, as its leadership felt the war would end soon enough that such a program was unnecessary. Numerous US dogs did serve in the Red Cross, whose dogs bore the red-cross emblem on their saddlebags. Americans borrowed dogs from their allies, as they had no organized dog units.\nMercy dogs were considered symbolic of patriotism, Jill Lenk Schilp writes that they were \"elevated to heroic levels and attributed human emotions and characteristics Some dogs may have had traumatic stress as a result of their service. The American dog Sergeant Stubby, who located wounded service personnel among other activities, was not honoured with a Dickin Medal (the animal equivalent of a Victoria Cross), as many animals were.

Because of the delay in production of antibody, this first foal is not at risk for isoerythrolysis since the mare will not have circulating antibodies until after colostrum production has ceased, meaning this foal will never have a chance for exposure. However, subsequent foals that are by the same stallion or a different stallion that carries the same incompatible blood group, are at risk, and as such this disease is most commonly seen in foals out of multiparous mares. Additionally, exposure can occur due to placental abnormalities in early gestation that allow the foal's red blood cells to leak into the mare's circulation, or if the mare is exposed through blood transfusion. Because this exposure occurs well before the foal receives colostrum, the mare will have circulating antibodies at the time of parturition and therefore the foal is at risk of developing NI.\nDuring the final month of gestation, alloantibodies concentrate into the colostrum. Horses, unlike humans, have an epitheliochorial placenta which prevents the transfer of antibodies to the foal in-utero. Foals are only exposed when they first nurse and ingest colostrum, so therefore are born without the disease and acquire it soon after birth. After ingestion, these antibodies coat the red blood cells of the foal, leading to lysis through the complement system or removal by the mononuclear phagocyte system, and causing subsequent anemia.", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neonatal_isoerythrolysis"}

However, a few factors, such as Aa and Qa, do lead to a significant response and therefore account for the majority of cases of isoerythrolysis. Mares that are Aa- and Qa-negative are therefore most likely to produce a foal with this condition. This is most commonly seen in Thoroughbreds (19%) and Arabians.

These natural alloantibodies have not been shown to produce isoerythrolysis in foals, and are actually thought to help prevent NI by desensitization of the immune system and preventing the more harmful Aa alloantibodies from forming.\nAlloantibodies against De, Ua, Pa, and Ab blood groups have also been associated with neonatal isoerythrolysis.", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neonatal_isoerythrolysis"}

Signs typical of hemolytic anemia occur, including tachycardia (increased heart rate), tachypnea (increased respiratory rate), dyspnea, pale mucosa which becomes icteric by 24–48 hours of age, and occasionally hemoglobinuria. In more severe cases, seizures may occur secondary to cerebral hypoxia. Laboratory findings will show a decreased packed cell volume (PCV) that is usually less than 20%, an increased bilirubin, especially unconjugated bilirubin, and occult blood in the urine.\nA definitive diagnosis can only be made if alloantibodies are discovered in the mare's serum or colostrum and are shown to be against the foal's red blood cells. Such tests include crossmatching the mare's serum to washed red blood cells of the foal, which is added to exogenous complement, and is positive if hemolysis occurs. A direct Coombs test may also be used, but does have a high rate of false negatives. Crossmatching using saline agglutination does run the risk of false negatives, since some alloantibodies only produce lysis rather than agglutination. Currently, screening tests of colostrum for use in the field have not been found to be accurate.\nThe severity of clinical signs and their speed of onset is determined by the dose of alloantibodies taken in by the foal and their potency. Alloantibodies against the Aa blood group are especially potent, and usually produce more severe signs than other alloantibodies when an equivalent dose is absorbed.

The mare should be stripped of milk and the foal muzzled during the time to prevent additional ingestion of colostrum. However, this disease is usually diagnosed in foals greater than 24 hours of age, in which case the foal is safe to continue to ingest the mother's milk. Foals are supported with fluids, which are used to maintain hydration, correct electrolyte and acid-base imbalances, and help perfuse the stressed kidneys which can be damaged by the circulating hemoglobin. Foals are kept warm and as quiet as possible, and exercise is limited. Intranasal oxygen may be used to improve blood oxygen levels. Antimicrobials are also sometimes given to help prevent sepsis, which is more likely to occur in a compromised foal.\nBlood transfusion is indicated if PCV drops below 12%,. The mare's blood may be used for transfusion if the red blood cells are washed multiple times to remove the serum component containing antibodies. If the mare can not be used, an alternative donor that is Aa and Qa negative may be used. This donor profile is most commonly seen in Quarter Horses, Morgans, and Standardbreds and is less likely in Thoroughbreds and Arabians, but ideally the donor should be blood typed prior to use rather than using breed as the sole method of identification. In mule foals, female donors that have been previously bred to a jack should not be used. Transfusion usually consists of 2-4 L of blood, or 1-2 L of packed cells, over the course of 2–4 hours. Blood transfusion is not without risks: these cells stress the mononuclear phagocytic system, increasing the foal's risk of infection, and also may lead to future transfusion reactions, so transfusion should only occur if required to save the animal's life. In the rare case where a suitable donor is not available or hemoglobin levels drop below 5 mg/dl, polymerized bovine hemoglobin may be given. PCV declines 4–7 days after initial transfusion. Dexamethasone is also sometimes used, but can affect blood glucose regulation of the patient.\nPrognosis depends on the amount of alloantibody received and their potency, which may be indirectly measured by the degree of clinical signs.

Chemotherapy is used following surgeries or to remove a tumor that cannot be accessed. Tumors that are caught when the cancer has already spread to other places of the body will result in the dog living for only 6-12 more months.\nThe most common type of oral cancer seen in cats is squamous cell carcinoma. Due to tumors developing in hidden spots such as beneath the tongue, when the tumors in the cats mouth are caught it is often untreatable.

Although the name \"osteochondritis\" implies inflammation, the lack of inflammatory cells in histological examination suggests a non-inflammatory cause. It is thought that repetitive microtrauma, which leads to microfractures and sometimes an interruption of blood supply to the subchondral bone, may cause subsequent localized loss of blood supply or alteration of growth.\nTrauma, rather than avascular necrosis, is thought to cause osteochondritis dissecans in juveniles. In adults, trauma is thought to be the main or perhaps the sole cause, and may be endogenous, exogenous or both. The incidence of repetitive strain injury in young athletes is on the rise and accounts for a significant number of visits to primary care; this reinforces the theory that OCD may be associated with increased participation in sports and subsequent trauma. High-impact sports such as gymnastics, soccer, basketball, lacrosse, football, tennis, squash, baseball and weight lifting may put participants at a higher risk of OCD in stressed joints (knees, ankles and elbows).\nRecent case reports suggest that some people may be genetically predisposed to OCD.

Feeding for forced growth and selective breeding for increased size are also factors. OCD has also been studied in other animals—mainly dogs, especially the German Shepherd—where it is a common primary cause of elbow dysplasia in medium-large breeds.\nIn animals, OCD is considered a developmental and metabolic disorder related to cartilage growth and endochondral ossification. Osteochondritis itself signifies the disturbance of the usual growth process of cartilage, and OCD is the term used when this affects joint cartilage causing a fragment to become loose.\nAccording to the Columbia Animal Hospital the frequency of affected animals is dogs, humans, pigs, horses, cattle, chickens, and turkeys, and in dogs the most commonly affected breeds include the German Shepherd, Golden and Labrador Retriever, Rottweiler, Great Dane, Bernese Mountain Dog, and Saint Bernard. Although any joint may be affected, those commonly affected by OCD in the dog are: shoulder (often bilaterally), elbow, knee and tarsus.\nThe problem develops in puppyhood although often subclinically, and there may be pain or stiffness, discomfort on extension, or other compensating characteristics. Diagnosis generally depends on X-rays, arthroscopy, or MRI scans. While cases of OCD of the stifle go undetected and heal spontaneously, others are exhibited in acute lameness. Surgery is recommended once the animal has been deemed lame.\nOsteochondritis dissecans is difficult to diagnose clinically as the animal may only exhibit an unusual gait.

The term was drawn directly from the medieval Latin word for magpie, a bird subject to much folklore regarding its opportunistic feeding behaviors.\nAccording to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5), pica as a standalone eating disorder must persist for more than one month at an age when eating such objects is considered developmentally inappropriate, not part of culturally sanctioned practice, and sufficiently severe to warrant clinical attention. Pica may lead to intoxication in children, which can result in an impairment of both physical and mental development. In addition, it can cause surgical emergencies to address intestinal obstructions, as well as more subtle symptoms such as nutritional deficiencies, particularly iron deficiency, as well as parasitosis. Pica has been linked to other mental disorders. Stressors such as psychological trauma, maternal deprivation, family issues, parental neglect, pregnancy, and a disorganized family structure are risk factors for pica.\nPica is most commonly seen in pregnant women, small children, and people who may have developmental disabilities such as autism. Children eating painted plaster containing lead may develop brain damage from lead poisoning.

Astrogliosis (an increase in the number of astrocytes) is also noted.  The lesions are most commonly found in the lateral pyramidal tract of the lumbar spinal cord, the fasciculi gracili of the dorsal column of the cervical spinal cord, and the cerebellar vermian white matter.  Symptoms start at the age of 8 to 10 weeks, and include frequent falling and walking on the hock.  The prognosis is poor.  The disease is suspected to have a recessive mode of inheritance.\nBotulism is very rare in dogs and usually follows feeding on carrion.  Symptoms include weakness, difficulty eating, acute facial nerve paralysis, and megaesophagus.  Compared to other species, dogs and cats are relatively resistant to botulism.\nDancing Doberman disease primarily affects the gastrocnemius muscle in Dobermans.  It usually starts between the ages of 6 and 7 months.  One rear leg will flex while standing.  Over the next few months, it will begin to affect the other rear leg.  Eventually, the dog is alternatively flexing and extending each rear leg in a dancing motion.  Dancing Doberman disease progresses over a few years to rear leg weakness and muscle atrophy.  No treatment is known, but most dogs retain the ability to walk and it is painless.\nDiabetes neuropathy is more common in cats than dogs.  It is caused in part by prolonged hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) and results in dysfunction of one or both tibial nerves and a plantigrade stance (down on the hocks).  It may resolve with treatment of the diabetes.  The pathology of this condition in cats has been shown to be very similar to diabetic neuropathy in humans.\nDistal symmetric polyneuropathy symptoms include atrophy of the distal leg muscles and the muscles of the head, and rear limb weakness.  No treatment is known and the prognosis is poor.  This is most commonly seen in Chesapeake Bay Retrievers, St. Bernards, Great Danes, Newfoundlands, Collies, and Labrador Retrievers.\nDysautonomia is primarily seen in cats.  Symptoms include vomiting, depression, anorexia, weight loss, dilated pupils, third eyelid protrusion, sneezing, slow heart rate, and megaesophagus.  The prognosis is poor and supportive treatment is necessary.  Recovery in cats may take up to one year.\nGiant axonal neuropathy is a rare disease in the German Shepherd dog.  It usually becomes evident between the ages of 14 and 16 months.  Symptoms include rear limb weakness, decreased reflexes, muscle atrophy, megaesophagus, and loss of bark.  No treatment is known and it has a poor prognosis.\nHyperchylomicronemia or hyperlipoproteinemia is a type of inherited hyperlipidemia in cats.  Polyneuropathy is caused by stretching or compression of nerves near bone by xanthomas, which are lipid deposits.  It can cause Horner's syndrome, facial nerve paralysis, and femoral nerve, tibial nerve, radial nerve, trigeminal nerve, or recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis.\nHypertrophic neuropathy  is also known as canine inherited demyelinative neuropathy (CIDN) and is inherited in the Tibetan Mastiff. Symptoms usually start between the ages of 7 and 10 weeks, and include weakness, decreased reflexes, and loss of bark.  Sensory function remains, but a poor gait or an inability to walk may present.  With no treatment available, the prognosis is guarded.  The trait is inherited as an autosomal recessive.\nHypoglycemia-induced  polyneuropathy is especially seen in conjunction with insulinoma.\nMyasthenia gravis\nPolyradiculoneuritis is inflammation of the nerve roots.  The most common type is Coonhound paralysis.  This is similar to Guillain–Barré syndrome in humans.  Coonhound paralysis seems to be secondary to a raccoon bite, probably due to some factor in the saliva.  However, it can also occur without any interaction with a raccoon. It can happen in any breed of dog.  When associated with a raccoon bite, the symptoms start 7 to 11 days after the bite, and include rear leg weakness progressing rapidly to paresis, and decreased reflexes.  When not associated with a raccoon bite, the same symptoms occur, with the paresis taking about 3–4 days to reach its maximum effect. Severe cases have a loss of bark, trouble breathing, and an inability to lift the head.  Typically, the duration of the paralysis is 2 to 3 months, but can last up to 6 months. Treatment is proper nursing care, and the prognosis is good in mild cases. In bad cases, the dog does not completely recover the initial muscular capability but still is able to live for years.  In very bad cases, breathing can be impaired, and unless the dog is placed on a ventilator, suffocation will occur. Polyradiculoneuritis has also been seen 1-2o weeks after vaccination in dogs and cats.  It can also be caused by toxoplasmosis.\nRottweiler distal sensorimotor polyneuropathy is characterized by distal muscle denervation, but the cause is unknown.  It affects young adult Rottweilers.  The symptoms include weakness of all four legs and decreased reflexes.  The disease is gradually progressive.  Treatment is possible with corticosteroids, but the prognosis is poor.\nSensory neuropathies are inherited conditions in dogs and cause an inability to feel pain and a loss of proprioception.  Self-mutilation is often seen.  No treatment has been found, and the prognosis is poor in severe cases.  Several breeds are affected:\nBoxer symptoms usually occur around two months of age as a slowly progressive disease.\nDachshund (longhaired) disease usually occurs between 8 and 12 weeks of age, and causes urinary incontinence, loss of pain sensation all over the body, and penis mutilation.  It is probably inherited as an autosomal recessive trait.\nEnglish Pointer illness usually occurs between the ages of 3 and 8 months and most commonly involves licking and biting at the paws.  No treatment is known and a poor prognosis is given.  It is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait.\nSpinal muscular atrophy occurs in cats and dogs, and is caused by the death of nerve cells in the spinal cord.  This progressive disease has no known treatment and a poor prognosis.  Affected dog breeds include the Swedish Lapland Dog, Brittany Spaniel, English Pointer, German Shepherd dog, Rottweiler, and Cairn Terrier. Maine Coons are one of the affected cat breeds.\nTick paralysis is an acute, ascending motor paralysis that occurs in dogs and cats.   The cause is a neurotoxin in the saliva of certain species of adult ticks.  Dermacentor species predominate as a cause in North America, while Ixodes species mainly cause the disease in Australia.  The onset of symptoms is 5 to 9 days after tick attachment, and include incoordination progressing to paralysis, changed voice, and difficulty eating.  Death can occur secondary to paralysis of the respiratory muscles, but in North America, a good prognosis results once the ticks are removed.  Recovery is usually in 1 to 3 days.  In Australia, however, it is a more severe disease with cranial nerve effects, and death can occur in 1 to 2 days.\nToxic neuropathies are most commonly caused by vincristine, thallium, and lead.

Eventually, this may cause the body to temporarily lose the ability to manufacture natural corticosteroids (especially cortisol), which results in dependence on prednisone. For this reason, prednisone should not be abruptly stopped if taken for more than seven days; instead, the dosage should be gradually reduced. This weaning process may be over a few days if the course of prednisone is short but may take weeks or months if the patient had been on long-term treatment. Abrupt withdrawal may lead to an Addisonian crisis. For those on chronic therapy, alternate-day dosing may preserve adrenal function and thereby reduce side effects.\nGlucocorticoids act to inhibit feedback of both the hypothalamus, decreasing corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), and corticotrophs in the anterior pituitary gland, decreasing the amount of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). For this reason, glucocorticoid analogue drugs such as prednisone down-regulate the natural synthesis of glucocorticoids. This mechanism leads to dependence in a short time and can be dangerous if medications are withdrawn too quickly. The body must have time to begin synthesis of CRH and ACTH and for the adrenal glands to begin functioning normally again.\nPrednisone may start to result in the suppression of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis if used at doses 7–10 mg or higher for several weeks. This is approximately equal to the amount of endogenous cortisol produced by the body every day. As such, the HPA axis starts to become suppressed and atrophy. If this occurs the patient should be tapered off prednisone slowly to give the adrenal gland enough time to regain its function and endogenous production of steroids.", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prednisone"}

This effect is a form of negative feedback on the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis (HPG axis) and takes advantage of the mechanism that the body uses to prevent sex hormone levels from becoming too high. Accordingly, progestogens, both endogenous and exogenous (i.e., progestins), have antigonadotropic effects, and progestogens in sufficiently high amounts can markedly suppress the body's normal production of progestogens, androgens, and estrogens as well as inhibit fertility (ovulation in women and spermatogenesis in men).\nProgestogens have been found to maximally suppress circulating testosterone levels in men by up to 70 to 80% at sufficiently high doses. This is notably less than that achieved by GnRH analogues, which can effectively abolish gonadal production of testosterone and suppress circulating testosterone levels by as much as 95%. It is also less than that achieved by high-dose estrogen therapy, which can suppress testosterone levels into the castrate range similarly to GnRH analogues.\nThe retroprogesterone derivatives dydrogesterone and trengestone are atypical progestogens and unlike all other clinically used progestogens do not have antigonadotropic effects nor inhibit ovulation even at very high doses.

This is best illustrated by the development of the severity of the disease in Denmark, where import of swine had been forbidden for decades up to 1972. Before 1964 only genital strains were spread, but then respiratory strains appeared, which subsequently were spread rapidly over the country, mainly by the trade of animals. In the late 1970s more virulent strains developed. The disease in swine became much more severe, outbreaks of respiratory disease in cattle rose dramatically, and the infection was spread airborne to other swine herds. The higher virulence of these virus strains was associated with a certain ability to create syncytia (cell fusion) in tissue cultures (syncytial virus strains). Comprehensive restriction fragment pattern analyses of virus DNA have documented that the more virulent strains had not been introduced from abroad but had developed in two steps from the original Danish strains. The correlation between high virulence of virus strains and syncytium formation in tissue cultures was confirmed by examinations of isolates from other countries. This second step in the severity development of the disease in Denmark caused the decision to eradicate. New outbreaks after the eradication of the indigenous infection by the end of 1985 were all caused by foreign highly virulent, syncytial strains introduced by airborne transmission from Germany.\nBriefly, PRV is spread either genitally or respiratorily.

Mortality is highest in young piglets. Pregnant sows often abort when infected. Otherwise healthy male adults (boars) are typically latent carriers, that is, they harbor and transmit the virus without displaying signs or experiencing disability.\nSwine (both domestic and feral) are usual reservoirs for this virus, though it does affect other species. Aujeszky's disease has been reported in other mammals, including brown bears, and black bears, Florida panthers, raccoons, coyotes, and whitetail deer. In most cases, contact with pigs or pig products was either known or suspected. Outbreaks in farm fur species in Europe (mink and foxes) have been associated with feeding contaminated pig products. Many other species can be experimentally infected. Humans are not potential hosts.\nCattle have been found to be infected either by the respiratory or the vaginal route (iatrogenic cases disregarded). Primary infection of mucous membranes of the upper respiratory tract is associated with head pruritus, while lung infection results in chest pruritus. Vaginal infection of bovines, which regularly show pruritus of the hindquarters, has been found to be associated with a concurrent genital infection in swine on the same premises, and investigations have evidenced that the vaginal infection of cattle had been sexually transmitted by man from infected sows.

The main risk period for a female is for eight weeks after her peak standing heat has ended.

Although this disease was first reported in 1884 the species infecting humans - Pythium insidiosum - was only formally recognised in 1987. Diagnosis can be difficult in part because of a lack of awareness of the disease. It does not appear to be transmissible either animal to animal or animal to human.

Symptoms often appear once the disease has progressed to the point where treatments are less effective. \nAs the organism is neither a bacterium, virus, nor fungus, routine tests often fail to diagnose it. In cytology and histology, the organism does not stain using Giemsa, H&E, or Diff-Quick, but the hyphae are outlined by surrounding tissue. GMS staining is required to identify the hyphae in slides, and highlights the lack of septation which helps distinguish the organism from fungal hyphae. Granulomatous inflammation with numerous eosinophils is suggestive that the hyphae are oomycetes rather than fungi, which are less likely to attract eosinophils.  The symptoms are usually nonspecific and the disease may not be included in a differential diagnosis in human medicine, though it is familiar to veterinarians.\nBiopsies of infected tissues are known to be difficult to culture, but can help narrow the diagnosis to several different organisms. A definite diagnosis is confirmed using ELISA testing of serum for pythiosis antibodies, or by PCR testing of infected tissues or cultures.\nDue to the poor efficacy of single treatments, pythiosis infections are often treated using a variety of different treatments, all with varying success.  Most successful treatments include surgery, immunotherapy, and various prescription drugs.\nAggressive surgical resection is the treatment of choice for pythiosis. Because it provides the best opportunity for cure, complete excision of infected tissue should be pursued whenever possible. When cutaneous lesions are limited to a single distal extremity, amputation is often recommended. In animals with gastrointestinal pythiosis, segmental lesions should be resected with 5-cm margins whenever possible. Unfortunately, surgical excision of tissue and amputation do not guarantee complete success and lesions can reappear. So, surgery is often followed by other treatments.\nAn immunotherapy product derived from antigens of P. insidiosum has been used successfully to treat pythiosis.\nCase reports indicate the use of the following prescription drugs with varying levels of success: potassium iodide, amphotericin B, terbinafine, itraconazole, fluconazole, ketoconazole, natamycin, posaconazole, voriconazole, prednisone, flucytosine,  liposomal nystatin and azithromycin + doxycycline.", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythiosis"}

{"condition": "Rabies", "species": "mixed", "section": "unlabelled", "paragraph_id": 0, "text": "Rabies is a viral disease that causes encephalitis in humans and other mammals. It was historically referred to as hydrophobia (\"fear of water\") because its victims panic when offered liquids to drink. Early symptoms can include fever and abnormal sensations at the site of exposure. These symptoms are followed by one or more of the following symptoms: nausea, vomiting, violent movements, uncontrolled excitement, fear of water, an inability to move parts of the body, confusion, and loss of consciousness. Once symptoms appear, the result is virtually always death. The time period between contracting the disease and the start of symptoms is usually one to three months but can vary from less than one week to more than one year. The time depends on the distance the virus must travel along peripheral nerves to reach the central nervous system.\nRabies is caused by lyssaviruses, including the rabies virus and Australian bat lyssavirus. It is spread when an infected animal bites or scratches a human or other animals. Saliva from an infected animal can also transmit rabies if the saliva comes into contact with the eyes, mouth, or nose. Globally, dogs are the most common animal involved. In countries where dogs commonly have the disease, more than 99% of rabies cases in humans are the direct result of dog bites. In the Americas, bat bites are the most common source of rabies infections in humans, and less than 5% of cases are from dogs. Rodents are very rarely infected with rabies. The disease can be diagnosed only after the start of symptoms.\nAnimal control and vaccination programs have decreased the risk of rabies from dogs in a number of regions of the world. Immunizing people before they are exposed is recommended for those at high risk, including those who work with bats or who spend prolonged periods in areas of the world where rabies is common. In people who have been exposed to rabies, the rabies vaccine and sometimes rabies immunoglobulin are effective in preventing the disease if the person receives the treatment before the start of rabies symptoms. Washing bites and scratches for 15 minutes with soap and water, povidone-iodine, or detergent may reduce the number of viral particles and may be somewhat effective at preventing transmission. As of 2016, only fourteen people were documented to have survived a rabies infection after showing symptoms. However, research conducted in 2010 among a population of people in Peru with a self-reported history of one or more bites from vampire bats (commonly infected with rabies), found that out of 73 individuals reporting previous bat bites, seven people had rabies virus-neutralizing antibodies (rVNA). Since only one member of this group reported prior vaccination for rabies, the findings of the research suggest previously undocumented cases of infection and viral replication followed by an abortive infection. This could indicate that people may have an exposure to the virus without treatment and develop natural antibodies as a result.\nRabies causes about 59,000 deaths worldwide per year, about 40% of which are in children under the age of 15. More than 95% of human deaths from rabies occur in Africa and Asia. Rabies is present in more than 150 countries and on all continents but Antarctica. More than 3 billion people live in regions of the world where rabies occurs. A number of countries, including Australia and Japan, as well as much of Western Europe, do not have rabies among dogs. Many Pacific islands do not have rabies at all. It is classified as a neglected tropical disease.\nThe global cost of rabies is estimated to be around US$8.6 billion per year including lost lives and livelihoods, medical care and associated costs, as well as uncalculated psychological trauma.", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabies"}
{"condition": "Rabies", "species": "mixed", "section": "unlabelled", "paragraph_id": 5, "text": "Transmission\nAll warm-blooded species, including humans, may become infected with the rabies virus and develop symptoms. Birds were first artificially infected with rabies in 1884; however, infected birds are largely, if not wholly, asymptomatic, and recover. Other bird species have been known to develop rabies antibodies, a sign of infection, after feeding on rabies-infected mammals.\nThe virus has also adapted to grow in cells of cold-blooded vertebrates. Most animals can be infected by the virus and can transmit the disease to humans. Worldwide, about 99% of human rabies cases come from dogs. Other sources of rabies in humans include bats, monkeys, raccoons, foxes, skunks, cattle, wolves, coyotes, cats, and mongooses (normally either the small Asian mongoose or the yellow mongoose).\nRabies may also spread through exposure to infected bears, domestic farm animals, groundhogs, weasels, and other wild carnivorans. However, lagomorphs, such as hares and rabbits, and small rodents, such as chipmunks, gerbils, guinea pigs, hamsters, mice, rats, and squirrels, are almost never found to be infected with rabies and are not known to transmit rabies to humans. Bites from mice, rats, or squirrels rarely require rabies prevention because these rodents are typically killed by any encounter with a larger, rabid animal, and would, therefore, not be carriers. The Virginia opossum (a marsupial, unlike the other mammals named in this paragraph, which are all eutherians/placental), has a lower internal body temperature than the rabies virus prefers and therefore is resistant but not immune to rabies. Marsupials, along with monotremes (platypuses and echidnas), typically have lower body temperatures than similarly sized eutherians. In 2024, reports emerged that rabies is spreading in South African Cape fur seals, possibly making it the first outbreak documented in marine mammals.\nThe virus is usually present in the nerves and saliva of a symptomatic rabid animal. The route of infection is usually, but not always, by a bite. In many cases, the infected animal is exceptionally aggressive, may attack without provocation, and exhibits otherwise uncharacteristic behavior. This is an example of a viral pathogen modifying the behavior of its host to facilitate its transmission to other hosts. After a typical human infection by bite, the virus enters the peripheral nervous system. It then travels retrograde along the efferent nerves toward the central nervous system. During this phase, the virus cannot be easily detected within the host, and vaccination may still confer cell-mediated immunity to prevent symptomatic rabies. When the virus reaches the brain, it rapidly causes encephalitis, the prodromal phase, which is the beginning of the symptoms. Once the patient becomes symptomatic, treatment is almost never effective and mortality is over 99%. Rabies may also inflame the spinal cord, producing transverse myelitis.\nAlthough it is theoretically possible for rabies-infected humans to transmit it to others by biting or otherwise, no such cases have ever been documented, because infected humans are usually hospitalized and necessary precautions taken. Casual contact, such as touching a person with rabies or contact with non-infectious fluid or tissue (urine, blood, feces), does not constitute an exposure and does not require post-exposure prophylaxis. But as the virus is present in sperm and vaginal secretions, it might be possible for rabies to spread through sex. There are only a small number of recorded cases of human-to-human transmission of rabies, and all occurred through organ transplants, most frequently with corneal transplantation, from infected donors.", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabies"}

If another person were bitten by a rabid dog and later died, the owner was heavily fined.\nIn ancient Greece, rabies was believed to be caused by Lyssa, the spirit of mad rage.\nIneffective folk remedies abounded in the medical literature of the ancient world. The physician Scribonius Largus prescribed a poultice of cloth and hyena skin; Antaeus recommended a preparation made from the skull of a hanged man.\nRabies appears to have originated in the Old World: the first epizootic in the New World occurring in Boston in 1768.\nRabies was considered a scourge for its prevalence in the 19th century. In France and Belgium, where Saint Hubert was venerated, the \"St Hubert's Key\" was heated and applied to cauterize the wound. By an application of magical thinking, dogs were branded with the key in hopes of protecting them from rabies.\nIn ancient times the attachment of the tongue (the lingual frenulum, a mucous membrane) was cut and removed, as this was where rabies was thought to originate. This practice ceased with the discovery of the actual cause of rabies. Louis Pasteur's 1885 nerve tissue vaccine was successful, and was progressively improved to reduce often severe side-effects.\nIn modern times, the fear of rabies has not diminished, and the disease and its symptoms, particularly agitation, have served as an inspiration for several works of zombie or similarly themed fiction, often portraying rabies as having mutated into a stronger virus which fills humans with murderous rage or incurable illness, bringing about a devastating, widespread pandemic.", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabies"}

The brains of animals with rabies deteriorate. As a result, they tend to behave bizarrely and often aggressively, increasing the chances that they will bite another animal or a person and transmit the disease.\nIn addition to irrational aggression, the virus can induce hydrophobia (\"fear of water\")—wherein attempts to drink water or swallow cause painful spasms of the muscles in the throat or larynx—and an increase in saliva production. This aids the likelihood of transmission, as the virus multiplies and accumulates in the salivary glands and is transmitted primarily through biting. The accumulation of saliva can sometimes create a \"foaming at the mouth\" effect, which is commonly associated with rabies in animals in the public perception and in popular culture; however, rabies does not always present as such, and may be carried without typical symptoms being displayed.\nRabies kills an average of 70,000 people a year worldwide.

In turn, the strict sense of \"reinforcement\" refers only to reward-based conditioning; the introduction of unpleasant factors and the removal or withholding of pleasant factors are instead referred to as \"punishment\", which when used in its strict sense thus stands in contradistinction to \"reinforcement\". Thus, \"positive reinforcement\" refers to the addition of a pleasant factor, \"positive punishment\" refers to the addition of an unpleasant factor, \"negative reinforcement\" refers to the removal or withholding of an unpleasant factor, and \"negative punishment\" refers to the removal or withholding of a pleasant factor.\nThis usage is at odds with some non-technical usages of the four term combinations, especially in the case of the term \"negative reinforcement\", which is often used to denote what technical parlance would describe as \"positive punishment\" in that the non-technical usage interprets \"reinforcement\" as subsuming both reward and punishment and \"negative\" as referring to the responding operant's evaluation of the factor being introduced. By contrast, technical parlance would use the term \"negative reinforcement\" to describe encouragement of a given behavior by creating a scenario in which an unpleasant factor is or will be present but engaging in the behavior results in either escaping from that factor or preventing its occurrence, as in Martin Seligman’s experiment involving dogs learning to avoid electric shocks.", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement"}
{"condition": "Reinforcement", "species": "mixed", "section": "unlabelled", "paragraph_id": 11, "text": "Other reinforcement terms\nA generalized reinforcer is a conditioned reinforcer that has obtained the reinforcing function by pairing with many other reinforcers and functions as a reinforcer under a wide-variety of motivating operations. (One example of this is money because it is paired with many other reinforcers).\nIn reinforcer sampling, a potentially reinforcing but unfamiliar stimulus is presented to an organism without regard to any prior behavior.\nSocially-mediated reinforcement involves the delivery of reinforcement that requires the behavior of another organism. For example, another person is providing the reinforcement.\nThe Premack principle is a special case of reinforcement elaborated by David Premack, which states that a highly preferred activity can be used effectively as a reinforcer for a less-preferred activity.\nReinforcement hierarchy is a list of actions, rank-ordering the most desirable to least desirable consequences that may serve as a reinforcer. A reinforcement hierarchy can be used to determine the relative frequency and desirability of different activities, and is often employed when applying the Premack principle.\nContingent outcomes are more likely to reinforce behavior than non-contingent responses. Contingent outcomes are those directly linked to a causal behavior, such a light turning on being contingent on flipping a switch. Note that contingent outcomes are not necessary to demonstrate reinforcement, but perceived contingency may increase learning.\nContiguous stimuli are stimuli closely associated by time and space with specific behaviors. They reduce the amount of time needed to learn a behavior while increasing its resistance to extinction.  Giving a dog a piece of food immediately after sitting is more contiguous with (and therefore more likely to reinforce) the behavior than a several minute delay in food delivery following the behavior.\nNoncontingent reinforcement refers to response-independent delivery of stimuli identified as reinforcers for some behaviors of that organism. However, this typically entails time-based delivery of stimuli identified as maintaining aberrant behavior, which decreases the rate of the target behavior. As no measured behavior is identified as being strengthened, there is controversy surrounding the use of the term noncontingent \"reinforcement\".", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement"}
{"condition": "Reinforcement", "species": "mixed", "section": "unlabelled", "paragraph_id": 21, "text": "Superimposed schedules\nThe psychology term superimposed schedules of reinforcement refers to a structure of rewards where two or more simple schedules of reinforcement operate simultaneously. Reinforcers can be positive, negative, or both. An example is a person who comes home after a long day at work. The behavior of opening the front door is rewarded by a big kiss on the lips by the person's spouse and a rip in the pants from the family dog jumping enthusiastically. Another example of superimposed schedules of reinforcement is a pigeon in an experimental cage pecking at a button. The pecks deliver a hopper of grain every 20th peck, and access to water after every 200 pecks.\nSuperimposed schedules of reinforcement are a type of compound schedule that evolved from the initial work on simple schedules of reinforcement by B.F. Skinner and his colleagues (Skinner and Ferster, 1957). They demonstrated that reinforcers could be delivered on schedules, and further that organisms behaved differently under different schedules. Rather than a reinforcer, such as food or water, being delivered every time as a consequence of some behavior, a reinforcer could be delivered after more than one instance of the behavior. For example, a pigeon may be required to peck a button switch ten times before food appears. This is a \"ratio schedule\". Also, a reinforcer could be delivered after an interval of time passed following a target behavior. An example is a rat that is given a food pellet immediately following the first response that occurs after two minutes has elapsed since the last lever press. This is called an \"interval schedule\".\nIn addition, ratio schedules can deliver reinforcement following fixed or variable number of behaviors by the individual organism. Likewise, interval schedules can deliver reinforcement following fixed or variable intervals of time following a single response by the organism. Individual behaviors tend to generate response rates that differ based upon how the reinforcement schedule is created. Much subsequent research in many labs examined the effects on behaviors of scheduling reinforcers.\nIf an organism is offered the opportunity to choose between or among two or more simple schedules of reinforcement at the same time, the reinforcement structure is called a \"concurrent schedule of reinforcement\". Brechner (1974, 1977) introduced the concept of superimposed schedules of reinforcement in an attempt to create a laboratory analogy of social traps, such as when humans overharvest their fisheries or tear down their rainforests. Brechner created a situation where simple reinforcement schedules were superimposed upon each other. In other words, a single response or group of responses by an organism led to multiple consequences. Concurrent schedules of reinforcement can be thought of as \"or\" schedules, and superimposed schedules of reinforcement can be thought of as \"and\" schedules. Brechner and Linder (1981) and Brechner (1987) expanded the concept to describe how superimposed schedules and the social trap analogy could be used to analyze the way energy flows through systems.\nSuperimposed schedules of reinforcement have many real-world applications in addition to generating social traps. Many different human individual and social situations can be created by superimposing simple reinforcement schedules. For example, a human being could have simultaneous tobacco and alcohol addictions. Even more complex situations can be created or simulated by superimposing two or more concurrent schedules. For example, a high school senior could have a choice between going to Stanford University or UCLA, and at the same time have the choice of going into the Army or the Air Force, and simultaneously the choice of taking a job with an internet company or a job with a software company. That is a reinforcement structure of three superimposed concurrent schedules of reinforcement.\nSuperimposed schedules of reinforcement can create the three classic conflict situations (approach–approach conflict, approach–avoidance conflict, and avoidance–avoidance conflict) described by Kurt Lewin (1935) and can operationalize other Lewinian situations analyzed by his force field analysis. Other examples of the use of superimposed schedules of reinforcement as an analytical tool are its application to the contingencies of rent control (Brechner, 2003) and problem of toxic waste dumping in the Los Angeles County storm drain system (Brechner, 2010).", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement"}

In some cases, the disease only appears when the animal develops an immunodeficiency condition. Circular bare patches on the skin suggest the diagnosis, but no lesion is truly specific to the fungus. Similar patches may result from allergies, sarcoptic mange, and other conditions. Three species of fungi cause 95% of dermatophytosis in pets: these are Microsporum canis, Microsporum gypseum, and Trichophyton mentagrophytes.\nVeterinarians have several tests to identify ringworm infection and identify the fungal species that cause it:\nWoods test: This is an ultraviolet light with a magnifying lens. Only 50% of M. canis will show up as an apple-green fluorescence on hair shafts, under the UV light. The other fungi do not show. The fluorescent material is not the fungus itself (which does not fluoresce), but rather an excretory product of the fungus which sticks to hairs. Infected skin does not fluoresce.\nMicroscopic test: The veterinarian takes hairs from around the infected area and places them in a staining solution to view under the microscope. Fungal spores may be viewed directly on hair shafts. This technique identifies a fungal infection in about 40%–70% of the infections, but cannot identify the species of dermatophyte.\nCulture test: This is the most effective, but also the most time-consuming, way to determine if ringworm is on a pet. In this test, the veterinarian collects hairs from the pet, or else collects fungal spores from the pet's hair with a toothbrush, or other instrument, and inoculates fungal media for culture. These cultures can be brushed with transparent tape and then read by the veterinarian using a microscope, or can be sent to a pathological lab. The three common types of fungi which commonly cause pet ringworm can be identified by their characteristic spores. These are different-appearing macroconidia in the two common species of Microspora, and typical microconidia in Trichophyton infections.\nIdentifying the species of fungi involved in pet infections can be helpful in controlling the source of infection. M. canis, despite its name, occurs more commonly in domestic cats, and 98% of cat infections are with this organism. It can also infect dogs and humans, however. T. mentagrophytes has a major reservoir in rodents, but can also infect pet rabbits, dogs, and horses. M. gypseum is a soil organism and is often contracted from gardens and other such places. Besides humans, it may infect rodents, dogs, cats, horses, cattle, and swine.", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatophytosis"}

It typically begins with a fever and headache, which is followed a few days later with the development of a rash. The rash is generally made up of small spots of bleeding and starts on the wrists and ankles. Other symptoms may include muscle pains and vomiting. Long-term complications following recovery may include hearing loss or loss of part of an arm or leg.\nThe disease is caused by Rickettsia rickettsii, a type of bacterium that is primarily spread to humans by American dog ticks, Rocky Mountain wood ticks, and brown dog ticks. Rarely the disease is spread by blood transfusions. Diagnosis in the early stages is difficult. Several laboratory tests can confirm the diagnosis but treatment should be begun based on symptoms. It is within a group known as spotted fever rickettsiosis, together with Rickettsia parkeri rickettsiosis, Pacific Coast tick fever, and rickettsialpox.\nTreatment of RMSF is with the antibiotic doxycycline. It works best when started early and is recommended in all age groups, as well as during pregnancy. Antibiotics are not recommended for prevention. Approximately 0.5% of people who are infected die as a result. Before the discovery of tetracycline in the 1940s, more than 10% of those with RMSF died.\nFewer than 5,000 cases are reported annually in the United States, usually in June and July. It has been diagnosed throughout the contiguous United States, Western Canada, and parts of Central and South America.

{"condition": "Rocky Mountain spotted fever", "species": "mixed", "section": "unlabelled", "paragraph_id": 4, "text": "Cause\nTicks are the natural hosts of the disease, serving as both reservoirs and vectors of R. rickettsii. Ticks transmit the bacteria primarily through their bites. Less commonly, infections may occur following exposure to crushed tick tissues, fluids, or tick feces.\nA female tick can transmit R. rickettsii to her eggs in a process called transovarial transmission. Ticks can also become infected with R. rickettsii while feeding on blood from the host in either the larval or nymphal stage. After the tick develops into the next stage, the R. rickettsii may be transmitted to the second host during the feeding process. Furthermore, male ticks may transfer R. rickettsii to female ticks through body fluids or spermatozoa during the mating process. These types of transmission represent how generations or life stages of infected ticks are maintained.  Once infected, the tick can carry the pathogen for life.\nRickettsiae are transmitted through saliva injected while a tick is feeding. Unlike Lyme disease and other tick-borne pathogens that require a prolonged attachment period to establish infection, a person can become infected with R. rickettsii in a feeding time as short as 2 hours. In general, about 1-3% of the tick population carries R. rickettsii, even in areas where the majority of human cases are reported. Therefore, the risk of exposure to a tick carrying R. rickettsii is low.\nThe disease is spread by the American dog tick (Dermacentor variabilis), Rocky Mountain wood tick (D. andersoni), brown dog tick (Rhipicephalus sanguineus), and Amblyomma sculptum. Not all of these are of equal importance, and most are restricted to certain geographic areas.\nThe two major vectors of R. rickettsii in the United States are the American dog tick and the Rocky Mountain wood tick. American dog ticks are widely distributed east of the Rocky Mountains, and they also occur in limited areas along the Pacific Coast. Dogs and medium-sized mammals are the preferred hosts of an adult American dog tick, although it feeds readily on other large mammals, including human beings. This tick is the most commonly identified species responsible for transmitting R. rickettsii to humans. Rocky Mountain wood ticks (D. andersoni) are found in the Rocky Mountain states and southwestern Canada. The lifecycle of this tick takes up to three years to complete. Adult ticks feed primarily on large mammals. The larvae and nymphs feed on small rodents.\nOther tick species are naturally infected with R. rickettsii or serve as experimental vectors in the laboratory.

Selegiline is used in dogs to treat canine cognitive dysfunction (CCD) and, at higher doses, to treat pituitary-dependent hyperadrenocorticism (PDH).\nCCD is a form of dementia that mimics Alzheimer's disease in humans. Geriatric dogs treated with selegiline show improvements in sleeping pattern, reduced urinary incontinence, and increased activity level, with most showing improvements by one month of treatment. Though it is labeled for use in dogs only, selegiline has been used off-label for geriatric cats with cognitive dysfunction.\nPDH is a hormonal disorder and is analogous to pituitary-dependent Cushing's syndrome in humans. Selegiline's effectiveness in treating PDH has been disputed. Theoretically, it works by increasing dopamine levels, which downregulates the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) from the brain, eventually leading to reduced levels of cortisol. Some claim that selegiline is only effective at treating PDH caused by lesions in the anterior pituitary (which comprise most canine cases). The greatest sign of improvement is lessening of PDH-related abdominal distention.\nSide effects in dogs are uncommon, but they include vomiting, diarrhea, diminished hearing, salivation, decreased weight, and behavioral changes such as hyperactivity, listlessness, disorientation, and repetitive motions.\nSelegiline has been limitedly studied in large animals like horses and its dosage in these animals has not been established. In preliminary research, a dose of selegiline of 30 mg orally or intravenously in horses had no observable effects on behavior or locomotor activity.\nThe doses of selegiline used in animals are described as extremely high relative to those used in humans (which are ~0.1 mg/kg body weight).", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selegiline"}

The species that is the leading cause of infections in the Americas is Spirometra mansonoides. Some other species of Spirometra that have been diagnosed as causing infections are Spirometra felis, Spirometra decipiens, and Spirometra urichi. The species Spirometra felis was found in domestic cats, as well as Spirometra decipiens. This same species, (Spirometra decipiens) was also discovered when scientists fed dogs larvae from frogs.

In the copepods, the eggs develop into procercoid larvae that live in the body cavity of the copepod until the life cycle can continue. The second intermediate hosts include fish, reptiles, or amphibians that consume the copepods while drinking water. The larvae penetrate the intestinal tract of the second intermediate host, where they develop into the plerocercoid larvae and migrate and encyst into the subcutaneous tissues and muscles. After this step in the life cycle, the second intermediate host can get eaten by a larger fish or animal, but the plerocercoid larvae will not develop to a further developmental stage and will just re-encysts into the subcutaneous tissues and muscles of this new host. If this additional second intermediate host does not get eaten by a paratenic host, then the second intermediate host will eventually get eaten by a definitive host predator, typically a cat, and the cycle begins again. Humans are accidental hosts in the cycle, becoming infected with the plerocercoid larvae by ingestion of the first or second intermediate hosts.

Serious complications may develop in people who have a weakened immune system.\nSporotrichosis is caused by fungi of the S. schenckii species complex. Because S. schenckii is naturally found in soil, hay, sphagnum moss, and plants, it most often affects farmers, gardeners, and agricultural workers. It enters through small cuts in the skin to cause a fungal infection. In cases of sporotrichosis affecting the lungs, the fungal spores enter by inhalation. Sporotrichosis can be acquired by handling cats with the disease; it is an occupational hazard for veterinarians.\nTreatment depends on the site and extent of infection. Topical antifungals may be applied to skin lesions. Deep infection in the lungs may require surgery.  Systemic medications used include Itraconazole, posaconazole and amphotericin B. With treatment, most people will recover, but an immunocompromised status and systemic infection carry a worse prognosis.\nS. schenkii, the causal fungus, is found worldwide.

Struvite is the most common mineral found in urinary tract stones in dogs, and is found also in urinary tract stones of cats and humans. Struvite stones are potentiated by bacterial infection that hydrolyzes urea to ammonium and raises urine pH to neutral or alkaline values. Urea-splitting organisms include Proteus, Xanthomonas, Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, Staphylococcus, and Mycoplasma.\nEven in the absence of infection, accumulation of struvite crystals in the urinary bladder is a problem frequently seen in housecats, with symptoms including difficulty urinating (which may be mistaken for constipation) or blood in the urine (hematuria). The protein cauxin, a protein excreted in large amounts in cat urine that acts to produce a feline pheromone, has recently been found to cause nucleation of struvite crystals in a model system containing the ions necessary to form struvite. This may explain some of the excess struvite production in domestic cats. In the past, surgery has been required to remove struvite uroliths in cats; today, special acidifying low magnesium diets may be used to dissolve sterile struvite stones.\nUpper urinary tract stones that involve the renal pelvis and extend into at least two calyces are classified as staghorn calculi.

The disease is an international health problem, as C. tetani endospores are ubiquitous. Endospores can be introduced into the body through a puncture wound (penetrating trauma). Due to C. tetani being an anaerobic bacterium, it and its endospores thrive in environments that lack oxygen, such as a puncture wound. With the changes in oxygen levels, the turkey drumstick-shaped endospore can quickly spread.\nThe disease occurs almost exclusively in people who are inadequately immunized. It is more common in hot, damp climates with soil rich in organic matter. Manure-treated soils may contain spores, as they are widely distributed in the intestines and feces of many animals, such as horses, sheep, cattle, dogs, cats, rats, guinea pigs, and chickens. In agricultural areas, a significant number of human adults may harbor the organism.\nThe spores can also be found on skin surfaces and in contaminated heroin. Rarely, tetanus can be contracted through surgical procedures, intramuscular injections, compound fractures, and dental infections. Animal bites can transmit tetanus.\nTetanus is often associated with rust, especially rusty nails. Although rust itself does not cause tetanus, objects that accumulate rust are often found outdoors or in places that harbor soil bacteria. Additionally, the rough surface of rusty metal provides crevices for dirt containing C. tetani, while a nail affords a means to puncture the skin and deliver endospores deep within the body at the site of the wound. An endospore is a non-metabolizing survival structure that begins to metabolize and cause infection once in an adequate environment. Hence, stepping on a nail (rusty or not) may result in a tetanus infection, as the low-oxygen (anaerobic) environment may exist under the skin, and the puncturing object can deliver endospores to a suitable environment for growth. It is a common misconception that rust itself is the cause; a related misconception is that a puncture from a rust-free nail is not a risk.", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetanus"}

They are oval and thin-shelled and enter the outside world via feces. The prepatency is two to four weeks. The larvae released from the eggs can bore through the skin into a new host (percutaneous infection) or be ingested perorally - mostly via collective hosts such as rodents. As with T. canis, infection of puppies is also possible through the mother's milk (galactogenic infection). Larvae dormant in the mammary gland can be shed over a period of up to three suckling periods after a bitch has been infected once.\nThe eggs of U. stenocephala are similar to those of A. caninum, but have a larger longitudinal axis of 85×45 μm. Infection occurs exclusively by peroral ingestion of larvae via contaminated food or collective hosts.\nIn Germany, an infection frequency of 8.6% was determined, in Austria of 0.1% for A. caninum and 0.2% for U. stenocephala. A Czech study determined a prevalence of 0.4% each for both hookworms, a Greek one of 2.8% together. In studies of domestic dogs in Serbia and Nigeria, hookworms were detectable in a quarter of the domestic dogs examined, but U. stenocephala was detectable in only 0.4% of animals. In Gabon, both hookworms were detectable in 35% of domestic dogs. In Canada, A. caninum was detected in only 1.3% of domestic dogs, but in the northeastern U.S. it was detected in 12%.

Male O. osleri grow to about 6–7 mm, females 10 to 13 mm. Eggs measure 80-120 × 60-70 μm, and larva L1 is about 250 μm long. F. hirthi is 2–3 mm (male) or 7–13 mm (female), and larva L1 is 240-290 μm long. Andersonstrongylus milksi (syn. Filaroides milksi) is a rare member of the Filaroididae in dogs and is largely similar to Filaroides hirthi in appearance, life cycle, and clinical presentation.\nThe parasites cause small nodules in the area of the bifurcation of the trachea or in the lung tissue; dead worms can also cause larger granulomas. The female worms lay eggs, which hatch into larvae that develop into the adult worm over five molts. Infection occurs either through eggs or the first larva, usually through direct contact with saliva, nasal secretions, or regurgitated stomach contents when the mother feeds the puppies. Infection via coprophagia is possible but rare. Self-infection of infested animals is also possible because the worms do not require an intermediate host. During infection, the larva migrates from the intestine via blood or lymphatic vessels into the bloodstream, from where it enters the lungs or tracheal wall and develops into the adult worm. The prepatency for O. osleri is ten weeks, and for F. hirthi five weeks.\nThe members of the Filaroididae occur worldwide. O. osleri is most common in foxes and other wild canines; infections of domestic dogs are rare. F. hirthi was first observed in beagle breed dogs in the United States, but now occurs worldwide and in other dog breeds, but especially in beagles kept as laboratory dogs.\nInfection with O. osleri causes chronic inflammation of the trachea and bronchi with a severe dry cough and abnormal breath sounds on inspiration. The disease usually does not manifest until the end of the first year of life and does not respond to antibiotic treatment. The simultaneous appearance of similar symptoms in the mother and her puppies is an indication of such an infection. Occasionally, seizure-like dyspnea may occur on exertion. For the most part, fever does not occur.\nDetection of nodules by means of pulmonary endoscopy, possibly also on chest radiographs, and of larvae in lung lavage fluid or tracheal swabs can be used for diagnosis.

It requires an intermediate host for its development; part of the development cycle - from the larval stage L1 to L3 (microfilariae) - takes place in mosquitoes. Transmission to the dog occurs during the sucking act. In the subcutis, the larva L4 develops, which enters the bloodstream where it sheds its skin to become the adult worms. The adult heartworms colonize the right half of the heart, the pulmonary vascular trunk and the sections of the vena cava close to the heart.

The microfilariae are then ingested by mosquitoes.\nTo date, over 70 species of mosquitoes have been identified as vectors, although none are native to Central Europe. In Turkey, 26% of domestic dogs have antibodies to D. immitis (seroprevalence). In the southern states of the U.S., seroprevalence is 4%, and in the northern states it is 1%.

Liver and kidney failure may also develop as a result of heart failure.\nFor diagnosis, the serological detection of D. immitis antigen is preferably used, which is highly specific and sensitive. In addition, microscopic detection of microfilariae is possible by blood examination with enrichment or occasionally by simple blood smear.

The parasite is distributed worldwide, but is rare in Europe. It is not restricted to the dog as the final host, but can infect most mammals (including humans). Reproduction and egg excretion can only occur if the same kidney is infested by both a female and a male worm and the worms have already perforated the renal pelvis. Eggs are excreted in the urine via the renal pelvis. These eggs are oval to cylindrical, yellow-brown, thick-walled, with a rough, knobbed surface, and 71-84 × 45-52 μm in size. The eggs embryonate within two weeks to three months, depending on the ambient temperature, and then become infectious to intermediate hosts.\nInfection occurs through consumption of intermediate or paratenic hosts, which contain cysts with larvae of the parasite. Intermediate hosts are earthworms and aquatic oligochaeta, in which larva L1 hatches and develops to larva L3; paratenic hosts are freshwater fish or frogs, in which larva L3 encapsulates in muscle flesh. The larva is released from its cyst in the digestive tract of the final host, penetrates the intestinal wall, and migrates to the liver for about 50 days. Subsequently, it penetrates directly through the abdominal cavity into the kidney, where it develops into the adult worm. The right kidney is more frequently affected than the left. In dogs, however, the parasite quite often remains in the abdominal cavity, which has less serious consequences for the dog than an infection of the kidney. The infected kidney is slowly destroyed by the parasite, which usually also perforates the renal pelvis in the process.

Obstruction of the lacrimal ducts or corneal inflammation may also occur. In case of heavy infection, the worms are already visible to the naked eye.

Trichinae have no external phase; infection occurs through the consumption of raw muscle meat from an infested animal. In Europe, Trichinella spiralis is most common in domestic animals; Trichinella britovi and Trichinella nativa are also found in dogs.\nIn the intestine, the muscle meat and cyst capsules are digested, releasing the larvae, which penetrate the mucosa of the duodenum and jejunum. There they develop into adult trichinae within about four days. After mating, the female worms bore deeper into the mucosa and lay up to 1500 eggs per individual over four to 16 weeks. The hatched larvae are about 100 microns long. They migrate first into the lymphatic vessels and then via the portal vein into the peripheral vascular system. Once they reach the musculature in the process, they leave the blood vessel and bore into a single muscle fiber. There they grow rapidly to a length of 1 mm, encapsulate and begin to take on the typical curled shape. Capsule formation in muscle tissue begins about 15 days after infection and is complete after four to eight weeks - the host's flesh is then infectious. Larvae can remain infectious in the muscles of a host for years; they are most commonly found in the diaphragm, tongue, masseter muscles, and intercostal muscles.\nLittle data exist on the frequency of Trichinella infection in dogs. In Finland, which has a very high prevalence of Trichinella in wildlife, dogs were serologically found to have an infection frequency between 4.9% and 8.6%. However, in the same study, cysts were detected in the muscle of only one of 102 dogs. In China, where dogs are slaughtered for human consumption, trichinae were detected in an average of 16.2% of slaughtered dogs during trichinae inspection, with prevalence varying from 1.2% to 44.8% depending on the region.", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nematode_infection_in_dogs"}

{"condition": "Threadworm infections of dogs", "species": "dog", "section": "unlabelled", "paragraph_id": 27, "text": "Combat\nMost infections are rather harmless for adult dogs, as a pathogen-host balance is established when the immune system is intact. However, since some of them can cause health disorders and some also pose a potential danger to humans, regular worming treatments for dogs are quite sensible. In particular, dogs in larger holdings, young animals, dogs in contact with other animals, hunting dogs, strays, and animals fed raw meat products are at higher risk of infection. The European Scientific Counsel Companion Animal Parasites (ESCCAP) - the European association of experts on parasites in dogs and cats - has therefore issued recommendations for the control of worm infections. These are adapted to regional specifics by national veterinary societies. In the United States, there are also such guidelines, issued here by the Companion Animal Parasite Council (CAPC).\nThe recommendations, which were last adapted in July 2014 according to the ESCCAP guidelines for Germany, aim to protect dogs \"(...) from infections with worms and their consequences through professional diagnostics, medication and prevention.\" Regular control is recommended especially for roundworms.\nSince puppies can be infected with roundworms at birth, they should be dewormed every 14 days from two weeks of age until weaning. Nursing bitches should also be treated during the first puppy deworming. Only monthly deworming offers reliable protection against passing on roundworms. According to ESCCAP, a monthly rotation may be considered for dogs that have a lot of contact with other dogs, have regular unsupervised exercise, or have close contact in families with young children. In principle, however, an individual risk assessment should be carried out for each animal. If this is not possible or if infections cannot be excluded by diagnostic tests, deworming four times a year is recommended. For special events, e.g. a sports competition or an exhibition, the ESCCAP recommends deworming once about four weeks before and again two to four weeks after the event. For treatment against roundworms, drugs based on emodepside, fenbendazole, flubendazole, mebendazole, milbemycin oxime, moxidectin, pyrantel and selamectin are approved in Germany for domestic dogs. These drugs are broad-spectrum anthelmintics and also exert activity against most other nematodes found in dogs. No preparation is currently approved for the treatment of pregnant bitches, although experimental studies have shown that the use of selamectin or emodepside in pregnancy effectively prevents infection of unborn puppies.\nHeartworm control in Germany only plays a role in dogs that are to be taken to endemic foreign countries (including southern and eastern European countries) or come from there. Moxidectin, milbemycinoxime, and selamectin are currently approved for therapy and prophylaxis of heartworm disease. In addition, protection with insect repellents such as permethrin or deltamethrin is recommended when traveling to heartworm endemic areas.\nTo minimize the infection pressure with worms in general, control of parasites in the environment is also important. Feces should be collected daily and disposed of in accordance with bio-hazardous waste disposal standards. Roundworm eggs, for example, are infectious in moist soil for up to four years, and whipworm eggs for over six years. These eggs have high tenacity, but are sensitive to prolonged temperatures above 35 °C and drought. Regular cleaning and disinfection measures are strongly recommended. Floors can be effectively cleaned with a steam cleaner at over 60 °C, care should be taken to ensure good drying afterwards. Flaming the kennel floor ensures elimination or at least reduction of infectious eggs and larvae. Most disinfectants are not effective against nematode eggs, nor are hand disinfectants, so gloves should be worn when handling feces.", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nematode_infection_in_dogs"}

Farmers, gardeners, canal workers, veterinarians and small children (playing in the sandbox) are particularly at risk. In Austria, antibodies to T. canis have been detected in 3.7% of healthy individuals (seroprevalence), and in 44% of individuals in exposed occupations. In Slovakia, seroprevalence has been found to be 12% in healthy blood donors from urban areas and 17% in those from rural areas. In the United States, 14% of the population is seropositive. An Egyptian study determined a seroprevalence of 18% in healthy adults, and a similarly high infection rate was found in children from rural regions in China. In Jordan, the seroprevalence is 11%, in Nigeria 30%, and in rural areas of Argentina 23%. However, these seroprevalence rates only indicate what percentage of the population has experienced an infection. However, such an infection does not necessarily have to result in disease, but can also be fought off by the immune system without symptoms of disease. In sandboxes of large European cities, contamination with worm eggs has been found in 10-100% of samples. Illnesses occur primarily in children and adolescents. The larvae of the canine roundworm can infect a wide variety of organs as visceral migrant larvae (larva migrans visceralis), where they cause severe tissue damage. The eyes, lungs, liver, and central nervous system are most commonly affected.\nThe larvae of A. caninum can penetrate the skin when walking barefoot over floors contaminated with dog feces. There, as migratory larvae (larva migrans cutanea, \"skin mole\"), they cause intensely itchy reddening of the skin. The ducts bored by the larvae are often visible to the naked eye. The disease usually heals spontaneously, although this can take months. Infections of this type are rare in Central Europe, however, but are one of the most common skin diseases in tropical and subtropical regions. In addition, A. caninum can also cause intestinal inflammation with signs of an acute abdomen.\nOf the filariae, the heartworm (Dirofilaria immitis) and Dirofilaria repens are zoonotic agents. D. immitis rarely causes disease in humans, although about 20% of the population in endemic areas have antibodies. In most cases, larval encapsulation occurs in the lungs. More than 400 cases have been described for D. repens, in Europe mainly in Italy and France. Seroprevalence in humans is 68% in Italy and 22% in France. The adult worms migrate mainly to the subcutis, but can invade all kinds of organs.\nThe dog plays a role in the spread of trichinellosis in only a few regions of the world. In China, the consumption of dog meat is an important source of infection for humans. For infestation with the eye worm (thelaziosis), four human cases have been described so far in Italy and France, but the disease is particularly widespread among the poorer population in Asia. In addition, dogs may contribute to the spread of non-host-specific parasites such as the giant kidney worm or medina worm. However, the epidemiological significance of domestic dogs for human infections has not yet been investigated for these parasites.\nTo avoid zoonotic worm infections in humans, hygiene is one of the most important preventive measures. These include washing hands, disposing of dog and cat feces, and also refraining from eating unwashed vegetables.", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nematode_infection_in_dogs"}

However, the timing may vary depending on the species of tick.\nUnlike Lyme disease, ehrlichiosis, and babesiosis, which are caused by the systemic proliferation and expansion of microbes after the offending tick is gone, tick paralysis is chemically induced by the tick and therefore usually only continues in its presence.

Collapse of the cervical trachea or extrathoracic (in the neck) occurs during inspiration; collapse of the thoracic trachea or intrathoracic (in the chest) occurs during expiration.  Tracheal collapse is most commonly found in small dog breeds, including the Chihuahua, Pomeranian, Toy Poodle, Shih Tzu, Lhasa Apso, Maltese, Pug, and Yorkshire Terrier.\nCongenital tracheal collapse appears to be caused by a deficiency of normal components of tracheal ring cartilage like glycosaminoglycans, glycoproteins, calcium, and chondroitin.  Acquired tracheal collapse can be caused by Cushing's syndrome, heart disease, and chronic respiratory disease and infection.\nSymptoms include a cough (often called a \"goose honk cough\" due to its sound), especially when the dog is excited.  This cough is usually paroxysmal in nature.  Other symptoms include exercise intolerance, respiratory distress, and gagging while eating or drinking.  Tracheal collapse is easily seen on a radiograph as a narrowing of the tracheal lumen.  Treatment for mild to moderate cases include corticosteroids, bronchodilators, and antitussives.  Medical treatment is successful in about 70 percent of tracheal collapse cases.  Severe cases can be treated with surgical implantation of a tracheal stent (inside or outside of the trachea) or prosthetic rings. Extraluminal (outside the trachea) stenting is generally used only for tracheal collapse in the neck region.

The hosts that affect infections in humans include the following: pigs, horses, wild boars, dogs, walruses, foxes, moose, and bears.\nIts life cycle begins with the ingestion of an infected animal's meat, or muscle tissue where the larvae of the parasite were encysted. The larvae are released when digested in the stomach and penetrate the intestinal mucosa of the small intestine where in about 48 hours, the larvae will reach their adult stage. The male and female adults mate and after 5-7 days after infection, the female worms release new larvae into the lymphatic and blood vessels. The larvae use these vessels as transportation to the highly oxygenated muscle cells in the body.Within a few weeks, the host's immune response with kill all of the adult worms in the body and the larvae will begin to penetrate the muscle tissue/cells.

During the initial infection, invasion of the intestines can result in diarrhea, abdominal pain, and vomiting. Migration of larvae to muscle, which occurs about a week after being infected, can cause swelling of the face, inflammation of the whites of the eyes, fever, muscle pains, and a rash. Minor infection may be without symptoms. Complications may include inflammation of heart muscle, central nervous system involvement, and inflammation of the lungs.\nTrichinosis is mainly spread when undercooked meat containing Trichinella cysts is eaten. Wild meat is more likely to contain the parasite. In North America this is most often bear, but infection can also occur from pork, boar, and dog meat. Several species of Trichinella can cause disease, with T. spiralis being the most common. After the infected meat has been eaten, the larvae are released from their cysts in the stomach. They then invade the wall of the small intestine, where they develop into adult worms. After one week, the females release new larvae that migrate to voluntarily controlled muscles, where they form cysts. The diagnosis is usually based on symptoms and confirmed by finding specific antibodies in the blood, or larvae on tissue biopsy.\nThe best way to prevent trichinosis is to fully cook meat. A food thermometer can verify that the temperature inside the meat is high enough. Infection is typically treated with antiparasitic medication such as albendazole or mebendazole. Rapid treatment may kill adult worms and thereby stop further worsening of symptoms. Both medications are considered safe but have been associated with side effects such as bone marrow suppression. Their use during pregnancy or in children under the age of 2 years is poorly studied but appears to be safe. Treatment with steroids is sometimes also required in severe cases. Without treatment, symptoms typically resolve within three months.\nWorldwide, about 10,000 trichinosis infections occur a year. At least 55 countries including the United States, China, Argentina, and Russia have had recently documented cases. While trichinosis does occur in the tropics, it is actually less common there.

It is specifically an inhibitor of 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-HSD). As a result of this action, trilostane blocks the conversion of Δ5-3β-hydroxysteroids, including pregnenolone, 17α-hydroxypregnenolone, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and androstenediol, into Δ4-3-ketosteroids, including progesterone, 17α-hydroxyprogesterone, androstenedione, and testosterone, respectively. Consequently, trilostane inhibits the production of all classes of steroid hormones, including androgens, estrogens, progestogens, glucocorticoids, and mineralocorticoids.\nThe mechanism of action of trilostane in Cushing's syndrome and Conn's syndrome is by inhibiting the production of corticosteroids such as cortisol and aldosterone in the adrenal glands. Trilostane has also been used as an abortifacient due to its inhibition of progesterone synthesis.\nTrilostane is not an aromatase inhibitor and hence does not inhibit the conversion of androgens like androstenedione and testosterone into estrogens like estrone and estradiol. However, trilostane may nonetheless inhibit estrogen synthesis by inhibiting androgen synthesis.\nIn addition to steroidogenesis inhibition, trilostane has been found to act as a noncompetitive antiestrogen, via direct and presumably allosteric interactions with the estrogen receptor. The effectiveness of trilostane in postmenopausal breast cancer may relate to this apparent antiestrogenic activity. Trilostane has also been found to act as an agonist of the androgen receptor.

The disease is known to affect several breeds of dogs as well as humans. Four types of hereditary VWD have been described, including platelet-type VWD, with VWD type 1 being the most common. Types 1 and 2 are inherited through an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning at least one parent must also have the disease.\nDiagnosis is typically confirmed through blood tests.

Within the horse community, any neurological problem that causes limb proprioception issues or decreased performance in the horse that is suspected to be rooted in the neck is considered a type of wobbler disease. Most forms of wobbler disease have a root cause in cervical vertebral myelopathy (CVM), which causes inflammation and arthritis in the joint and is painful to affected horses. At this time it is believed to possibly be a congenital condition. Mounting evidence is growing that points to CVM and other cervical and vertebral disorders (like Kissing Spine) as hereditary and found in populations of specific families.\nOther forms, such as cervical arthritis and equine wobbles anemia, are concentrated in certain breeds and demonstrate possible hereditary factors. Horses with wobbler disease often exhibit ataxia (implying dysfunction of parts of the nervous system), show weakness in the hindquarters, or may knuckle over in their fetlocks, particularly in the rear. They also may show overall stiffness especially in the neck and back and may not move fluidly. A common ataxic symptom is the horse will list to one side behind. They also may demonstrate uneven strides with one leg intermittently shorter in step. Horses with wobbler disease or cervical anomalies can demonstrate difficult to diagnose lamenesses that come and go, and often are not resolved by veterinary blocks to the limbs. With advanced stages of the disease, affected horses are prone to falling due to extreme listing behind and often demonstrate difficulty getting up from lying down, or reluctance to lie down at all. While some cases are successfully treated with nutritional and medical management, surgery is also used. One method is the use of titanium baskets, placed to fuse the vertebrae, thereby preventing compression of the spinal cord. Some horses are able to return to work, with a few able to reach competitive levels. No complete cure for the condition is known. Famous horses known to have completed basket surgery include Seattle Slew. Seattle Slew underwent two basket surgeries and has sired multiple offspring that have cervical arthritis. He is one of many Thoroughbred stallions to have undergone basket surgery and still be used for stud.\nBecause wobbler disease is the best known of the neurological conditions that affect horses, other, unrelated conditions, such as kissing spine, equine protozoal myeloencephalitis and cerebellar abiotrophy, are sometimes misdiagnosed as wobbler disease, though the causes and symptoms differ.", "source": "Wikipedia", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wobbler_disease"}

Dirofilariasis is caused by Dirofilaria immitis through mosquitoes infected by mammals like dogs and cats.
